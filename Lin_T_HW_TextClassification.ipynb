       " ['SubscribeBack IssuesContributeAdvertisebyKris DunnIf you follow the recruiting space, you likely would agree that three trends have dominated the recruitment marketing landscape in the past five to 10 years.LinkedIn has become the candidate database of choice for recruiters, Glassdoor has forced HR and recruiting leaders to acknowledge the importance of company reputation via aggregation of anonymous ratings, and Indeed has parlayed the power of jobs SEO/search into a dominant business model.But the more things change, the more they stay the same. Those market positions/origins converge as each of those recruitment-marketing vendors has sought to monetize their business model.Translation: LinkedIn, Glassdoor and Indeed all sell job postings as a primary driver of revenue. Some have found that embedding job postings in bundled offerings is the only way to fully monetize the features that made them famous (LinkedIn, Glassdoor), and one has fully redefined what a job posting is by owning candidate search and making you pay for preferred placement to access candidate attention (Indeed).But each of the business models is reliant on and subject to one important behavioral trend: Candidates aren\\xe2\\x80\\x99t using job boards as a starting point for job search, they\\xe2\\x80\\x99re just typing the name of a company in a web browser (or conducting a search like \\xe2\\x80\\x9cjobs in 30328\\xe2\\x80\\x9d), and away they go.That reality built Indeed into the powerhouse it is today. But there\\xe2\\x80\\x99s a new sheriff in town \\xe2\\x80\\x94 Google for Jobs.Google for Jobs can be described as a new search results feature when you use Google for search.\\xc2\\xa0 The feature is simple: For searches with \\xe2\\x80\\x9cclear intent\\xe2\\x80\\x9d (e.g., \\xe2\\x80\\x9chead of HR jobs in Chicago\\xe2\\x80\\x9d or \\xe2\\x80\\x9centry-level jobs in Boise\\xe2\\x80\\x9d), Google shows a formatted preview of job listings scraped from various sources under a generic tag, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cjobs.\\xe2\\x80\\x9dGoogle for Jobs currently includes job postings from sources like LinkedIn, CareerBuilder and Glassdoor, but also job postings hosted on a company\\xe2\\x80\\x99s own website \\xe2\\x80\\x94 if the bots like the formatting of your careers site.Google for Jobs doesn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t include listings for Indeed. And that should make you blink as an HR/talent/recruiting leader.The Google for Jobs search results serve to push organic listings at your company on Indeed, Glassdoor and other providers to what is known as \\xe2\\x80\\x9cbelow the fold\\xe2\\x80\\x9d status on their screen. That means candidates must scroll to find some of the results from the providers you currently pay to drive traffic to your jobs. That\\xe2\\x80\\x99s potentially a big problem.What\\xe2\\x80\\x99s an HR/recruiting leader to do? Here\\xe2\\x80\\x99s my advice to avoid waking up one day and finding the recruitment marketing world has passed you by in the Google for Jobs era:The naysayers will tell you Google\\xe2\\x80\\x99s had a lot of failed experiments \\xe2\\x80\\x94 Google Wave and Google Plus among them \\xe2\\x80\\x94 and they\\xe2\\x80\\x99re right.Candidate behavior toward job search suggests that those expecting Google for Jobs to have zero impact are misguided at best.

       " ['SubscribeBack IssuesContributeAdvertisebyJon HymanI\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve never written about the time I stripped naked in front of my entire law school \\xe2\\x80\\xa6 until now.Well, here we go.It was 1997 and I was a 3L at Case Western Reserve School of Law, biding my time until graduation and the bar exam.Looking for ways to spice up my final year of schooling, I volunteered to co-auctioneer the school\\xe2\\x80\\x99s annual fundraiser for its public interest law foundation.The event started at 6 pm. We tapped the keg around 4.Needless to say, I was several sheets to the wind before I gaveled my first item.Based on the relative popularity of certain faculty members, I thought I knew which donated items would raise the most money.One particular item that was expected to raise big dollars was being slow-bid. In my infinite wisdom (or drunken haze, my memory can\\xe2\\x80\\x99t quite decipher which), I decided that my fellow law students needed an enticement to quicken the bidding pace.\\xe2\\x80\\x9cWhen this item hits $500, I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll pull my pants down,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d I exclaimed!The plan was to drop my blue jeans, but leave the naughtiest bits safely behind the cover of my Gap boxers.Ah, the best laid plans. I had not accounted for the impact alcohol would have on my intended-to-be dexterous waste-band swipe.In my stuporous haste, I not only grabbed the waste of my jeans, but also that of the Gap boxers on whose hopes I had staked my modesty.Damn.So there I was, Jon and his \\xe2\\x80\\x9cfriends,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d for all to see (at least for the quick moment before I hoisted my britches).Here\\xe2\\x80\\x99s the employment lesson. (I can\\xe2\\x80\\x99t tell this story without bringing it 360 to an employment lesson.)I can guarantee that every candidate you consider for employment has at least one moment like this in their background. And, because of the prevalence of the iPhone (generically standing in for all smartphones) and the Facebook (generically standing in for all social media), many of those candidates will not be able to hide from these embarrassments.Your job as an employer is to determine which embarrassments are blips in the history of your future employee and which are red flags that scream \\xe2\\x80\\x9cDo Not Hire.\\xe2\\x80\\x9dThank god in 1997 there was no thing as iPhone or Facebook. But, even if there was, my Full-Monty moment would have in no way predicted my success as a lawyer. I haven\\xe2\\x80\\x99t had my clothes off in public since.So, use the internet to hire, but do not automatically assume that what you see is the be-all and end-all of every candidate. It is but one piece of the hiring puzzle, and, sometimes, it is in no way dispositive of the polished product you will hire.Jon Hyman is a partner at Meyers, Roman, Friedberg & Lewis in Cleveland.

       " ['SubscribeBack IssuesContributeAdvertisebySarah Fister GaleBig-name companies such as McDonald\\xe2\\x80\\x99s and Goldman Sachs have tested using Snapchat to recruit millennials.In April, McDonald\\xe2\\x80\\x99s Corp. showed surprising social media edge when it took its recruiting campaign to Snapchat, the mobile app that lets users exchange videos and images that self-destruct after a few seconds. The initial campaign began in Australia, where they encouraged candidates to use a Snapchat filter to try on virtual uniforms, then upload their own 10-second pitch in lieu of filling out a job application.In June, McDonald\\xe2\\x80\\x99s launched the campaign in the United States on a simpler scale. Instead of uploading videos, potential candidates could watch current employees talking for 10 seconds about how much they love their jobs, and they can swipe to see local job openings at the company\\xe2\\x80\\x99s career page.Even without the uniform filter and video application, it was a fun use of a social media platform that hasn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t gotten much attention from the recruiting world, said Ray Wang of Constellation Research Inc. It also makes a lot of sense for a company like McDonald\\xe2\\x80\\x99s. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cThey want to hire the 16- to 24-year-old demographic that uses Snapchat,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he said. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cIt is a great way to reach them.\\xe2\\x80\\x9dWhether this is the start of a new recruiting trend or just a gimmick remains to be seen. McDonald\\xe2\\x80\\x99s had a lot of things going for it to make this campaign a hit, said Jody Ordioni, president and chief branding officer for Brandemix, a\\xc2\\xa0brand marketing agency.\\xc2\\xa0It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s already a huge brand that is popular among the very people they are trying to hire \\xe2\\x80\\x94 millennials and Generation Z. And because it was a novel recruiting strategy, it was buzzworthy. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cMcDonald\\xe2\\x80\\x99s generated a lot of momentum by being first,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d she said.McDonald\\xe2\\x80\\x99s isn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t the only big company that has tried to figure out whether Snapchat is a viable recruiting tool and how to use it. In fact, they weren\\xe2\\x80\\x99t even the first.In 2016, Cisco took to Snapchat with its #WeAreCisco social media campaign, encouraging brand ambassadors from across the company to post content about life at Cisco directly to the channel \\xe2\\x80\\x94 without any reviews or attempts to edit. Cisco\\xe2\\x80\\x99s Talent Brand Team knew that the only way it would work was if the content was authentic, according to Social Media Manager Carmen Shirkey Collins. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cWe didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t want to be \\xe2\\x80\\x98marketers,\\xe2\\x80\\x99 we wanted to be \\xe2\\x80\\x98co-workers,\\xe2\\x80\\x99 \\xe2\\x80\\x9d she wrote in a blog about the project. The employees loved the idea, and not only created content for Snapchat but promoted it on their own social networks via other platforms. Collins reported a 600 percent follower increase week\\xc2\\xa0over week in the first three months of launching.Possibly the most surprising early adopter was financial giant Goldman Sachs, which ran its own recruiting campaign on Snapchat\\xe2\\x80\\x99s Campus Story platform in 2015 with a series of 10-second recruitment videos seeking \\xe2\\x80\\x9ccampus environmental leaders,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d \\xe2\\x80\\x9cyouth sports coaches\\xe2\\x80\\x9d and \\xe2\\x80\\x9ccrowd-funding champions.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d The snaps were only accessible to people in and around 60 targeted campuses and was part of the financial firm\\xe2\\x80\\x99s broader efforts to appeal to a younger, hipper candidate pool. The nine-day campaign accrued more than 2.1 million views and the company reported a significant increase in traffic to the Careers webpage.None of these companies released data around whether the campaigns actually translated into new hires, and because snaps only exist for a short time, users can\\xe2\\x80\\x99t go looking for these ads or use them to drive long-term results.That\\xe2\\x80\\x99s part of the problem, said Wang. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cIf you can\\xe2\\x80\\x99t generate viral activity around the campaign, it won\\xe2\\x80\\x99t work.\\xe2\\x80\\x9dThe Novelty FactorSnapchat presents many obstacles that make it tricky as a recruiting tool. Potential candidates have to already follow the brand to see the snaps, and they need to respond in real time for it to have an effect. And while using filters and videos can be a fun way to engage candidates, companies need to decide if they can judge someone by a 10-second video, or whether they can deliver a powerful enough recruiting message in that time to drive career-age traffic.That\\xe2\\x80\\x99s not to say Snapchat can\\xe2\\x80\\x99t be useful for recruiting if it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s used as part of the broader social media engagement effort and not a strategy unto itself. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cYou can\\xe2\\x80\\x99t rely on any single social media outlet to drive brand awareness,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Ordioni said. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cIt\\xe2\\x80\\x99s just one piece of the process.\\xe2\\x80\\x9dFor companies interested in expanding their social reach via Snapchat, Ordioni suggests campaigns be linked to a broader recruiting effort or event and designed to engage the largely younger demographic with genuine stories that will grab their attention.It also can\\xe2\\x80\\x99t be a one-off effort. As with any social media platform, followers expect a steady stream of original content \\xe2\\x80\\x94 not just the occasional self-promotional post \\xe2\\x80\\x94 so companies shouldn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t focus on Snapchat unless they have the bandwidth to generate that kind of continuous content, she said. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cIf you ask people to follow you on Snapchat, it has to be a long-term commitment.\\xe2\\x80\\x9dSarah Fister Gale is a writer in Chicago.

       " ['SubscribeBack IssuesContributeAdvertisebySimon RakosiLogging extra hours or being on call during evenings and weekends does not guarantee results. It can lead to burnout and diminished productivity.Barstool Sports CEO Erika Nardini became a victim of public scrutiny in August after telling the New York Times\\xc2\\xa0about a test she uses to measure a candidate\\xe2\\x80\\x99s commitment during the hiring process. Her system involves texting at an odd hour of the weekend to see how quickly the candidate will respond.Not surprisingly, the internet jumped on the soundbite. In vein with the premise of Jon Ronson\\xe2\\x80\\x99s \\xe2\\x80\\x9cSo You\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve Been Publicly Shamed,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d the executive is being tied to a single comment in a rather extreme fashion. Regardless of your take on Nardini\\xe2\\x80\\x99s vetting process, I\\xe2\\x80\\x99d argue that the conversation that has resulted is a net-positive for those of us in the business of building teams and companies.I must admit: The concept of \\xe2\\x80\\x9coverwork\\xe2\\x80\\x9d is a bit foreign to me. I grew up in Belgium, where society takes a much different approach to work-life balance. Last year, for example, France passed legislation making the case that employers cannot penalize their employees for failing to respond to emails during non-working hours. These types of policies are designed to protect workers against conditions that serve to threaten their well-being.On this very subject, Vox recently published an opinion piece that makes the case that today\\xe2\\x80\\x99s employers are like \\xe2\\x80\\x9cdictators,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d creating societies within the workplaces in which regulations (or \\xe2\\x80\\x9claws\\xe2\\x80\\x9d) are placed on employee-citizens that are designed to subjugate them to \\xe2\\x80\\x9ctyrannical\\xe2\\x80\\x9d conditions. Of course, the counter to this argument \\xe2\\x80\\x94 and to Nardini\\xe2\\x80\\x99s policy at Barstool \\xe2\\x80\\x94 is that employees choose to work at private companies at-will, and if the systems aren\\xe2\\x80\\x99t a fit for their lifestyles, they can always leave.From a business owner\\xe2\\x80\\x99s perspective, I would argue that policies and \\xe2\\x80\\x9ctests\\xe2\\x80\\x9d that promote over-work are counterproductive in the long term. Squeezing out productivity from employees during off-hours or cutting into their personal time might serve a short-term purpose, but in the long term these cultures are harder to sustain and make it difficult to attract and maintain top talent. Here\\xe2\\x80\\x99s why.Work-Life Balance Correlates to Overall HappinessEarlier this year, my company ran a study based on data compiled from a sample of 5,000 Butterfly users (employees) in the United States, Europe, the Middle East and Asia. Our aim was to understand the correlation between key drivers of engagement in the workplace \\xe2\\x80\\x94 like team dynamics, leadership and work-life balance \\xe2\\x80\\x94 and overall happiness. Our results showed that work-life balance had the strongest correlation with employee happiness, ranking above things like office environment (I.e., \\xe2\\x80\\x9cwork perks\\xe2\\x80\\x9d) and even managers.Companies have been using tactics like free beer and company merchandise to recruit millennials, but our study and other observations (like those made in Dan Lyons\\xe2\\x80\\x99 book, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cDisrupted: My Misadventure in the Startup Bubble\\xe2\\x80\\x9d) suggest that superficial perks aren\\xe2\\x80\\x99t what\\xe2\\x80\\x99s keeping young talent happy and productive at work. Instead, millennials are looking for balanced lifestyles promoted by strong managers who care about their well-being and professional development.The notion of servant leadership was birthed by Robert K. Greenleaf in 1970. His philosophy was that the strongest leaders are those that live to support and serve the needs of their teams. Managers with a \\xe2\\x80\\x9cservant-first\\xe2\\x80\\x9d mindset, therefore, are compelled to make sure that their employee\\xe2\\x80\\x99s highest priority needs are being met first \\xe2\\x80\\x94 in other words, it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s about being there for your employee at 9 p.m. on a Sunday and not the other way around.As a co-founder of a company that has grown from three co-founders to more than 15 employees in less than two years, I can\\xe2\\x80\\x99t help but scratch my head at the idea of expecting my people to be there for me during odd hours. In my mind, it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s about letting my team know that I will be there for them, regardless of the time of day or reason for their outreach.In fact, this idea that managers should be sourcing feedback from their teams on an ongoing basis is the founding principle of the employee intelligence startup I co-founded with my colleagues David Mendlewicz and Marcus Perezi-Tormos.Value Achievement Over ActivitySetting aside the cultural implications of expecting employees to sacrifice work/life balance for the \\xe2\\x80\\x9ccause,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d this philosophy also misses the mark when it comes to what truly makes great businesses survive and thrive. As a basketball player, I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll reference Hall of Fame coach John Wooden\\xe2\\x80\\x99s quote: \\xe2\\x80\\x9cNever mistake activity for achievement.\\xe2\\x80\\x9dIn the context of business, the act of logging extra hours or being on call during evenings and weekends does not guarantee results. It can lead to burnout and diminished productivity.No co-founder, myself included, is naive enough to believe that great businesses are built by clock watchers. Disrupting an industry, launching a new product, or overtaking fierce competition takes hard work, and a lot of it \\xe2\\x80\\x94 but this work should be measured by tangible goals and milestones \\xe2\\x80\\x94 not hours.Piling onto the scrutiny of a single soundbite from one CEO is not going to solve the broader issue of work martyrdom, but constructive conversations can help. While leaders will differ in their individual styles, I would offer that managers should explore ways that they can prove to their teams that they are committed to their employees\\xe2\\x80\\x99 personal growth and overall health. And, as always, actions will matter much more than words.Simon Rakosi is co-founder of Butterfly, an employee intelligence and management coaching platform that uses AI to help develop leadership skills at all levels of an organization.

We\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve been trained to believe that everyone needs it.Do they?I think so, but something that\\xe2\\x80\\x99s lost in the recognition/engagement market is that for many workers, getting recognition in the widely accepted formats can backfire.The reason I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m thinking about this is simple. I was recently asked to speak to a group of managers by a premiere provider in the talent management space. One of the features of the meeting after I spoke was a small spiral notebook of great ideas for the managers in question to use to create a power month of recognition for their teams.A great idea for sure by the provider in question. But as I looked around the room, I saw some poorly hidden discomfort on the faces of those who would have to take the ideas in question back to their teams.At issue wasn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t the merit of the ideas, but their utility for certain segments of the workforce. The managers in question were thinking about the reactions of many of their employees to specific ideas included in the booklet.I took it upon myself to follow up and ask the managers in question about the idea of doing a power month of recognition at their companies. What I heard can be summed up as follows: Recognition isn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t a one-size-fits-all affair. Some of the ideas viewed as best practices will be loathed by certain recipients.I couldn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t agree more; some notes from my life follow. My dad, Kent Dunn (RIP CKD), was a lifetime telephone/telecom lineman. One of the greatest things he gave me was a work ethic.The memory of hearing his boots hit the floor and go out the door while I was still in bed before school are riveted in my mind. He had a bunch of positive qualities you\\xe2\\x80\\x99d want in anyone you hired from a pride of work perspective.But one thing he never would have been comfortable with is public recognition. Here\\xe2\\x80\\x99s some things that are widely talked about today related to recognition he wouldn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t have been comfortable with, with his likely reaction in parenthesis to whoever was trying to reward him with any form of praise:Kent Dunn would have been uncomfortable with many of the recognition strategies we take for granted in white-collar America. I think many blue-collar workers we have today in America are a lot like Kent. When I think about alternative/best ways to do recognition for those folks (mostly older males in blue-collar jobs focused on making a living, not changing the world), I came up with the following two strategies:In both scenarios, the recognition is still there. The old school, blue-collar worker still hears it, but based on how it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s provided he doesn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t feel like you expect him to come in contact with his feelings.Feelings are scary for blue-collar employees, especially those of the male variety.The broader point for any of us thinking about recognition is simple. To maximize your approach and the subsequent results, you\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll have to customize your recognition programs for different employee segments.Failure to consider when and how to recognize individual segments can and will be held against you in the court of employee sentiment. If you\\xe2\\x80\\x99re wondering why your managers don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t use the recognition tools you provide, it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s likely because you haven\\xe2\\x80\\x99t provided them with choices that work for the employee types they manage.RIP Kent Dunn.

As a result, severe constipation likely qualifies.Assuming that constipation that is severe enough to keep one home from work qualifies as an ADA disability, what does one do with an employee who simply fails to come into work, without notice, because of the disability?Take a look at your attendance policy. Does it penalize employees who no-call/no-show? A protected disability (or FMLA qualifying event, if you are FMLA-covered) does not justify an employee to ignore your attendance policy, or its requirements. If your policy requires that an employee call out (when feasible), then you can enforce that policy even if the absence is related to a medical condition.Assuming the employee asks for a few days off to get things moving, you likely have to grant the request as a reasonable accommodation. For the record, I would not recommend Larry\\xe2\\x80\\x99s offered accommodation, a desk chair that doubles as a toilet.Your homework assignment? Dust off your attendance policy and review its requirements for sick employees missing work.

When she was hired in August 2013, she was required to sign an agreement that required her to arbitrate employment-related disputes with Finish Line.In mid-2014, after she was diagnosed with diabetes and anxiety that was exacerbated by sleeping issues that occurred during her pregnancy, Capili requested a leave. She was terminated July 8, 2014.

When Finish Line moved to compel the case to arbitration, the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California ruled that the arbitration agreement was both procedurally and substantively unconscionable.The Ninth Circuit appellate court agreed.

       " ['SubscribeBack IssuesContributeAdvertisebyKarleen MussmanCultural fit is a critical piece of the puzzle when a candidate is evaluating job responsibilities, benefits or even an offer.Whether you hire 10 or 1,000 people a year, a well-designed recruitment and retention process enabled by technology is the initial step to a successful placement. But every touch point with a candidate should be meaningful and convey consistent and compelling messages about a company and its culture.A sound recruiting framework may be important but it is culture that will differentiate your organization from competition both in recruiting and retention. Think culture first and last to attract and keep the best talent in an era of an unprecedented and increasingly competitive talent environment.Recruitment and retention efforts need to start with a sound foundation, and that can be accomplished with technology. Analytics validate and support much of the recruitment efforts at my company, Baker Tilly, and we use them to measure and evaluate our programs to understand a candidate\\xe2\\x80\\x99s life cycle. Analytics also allow us to assess where and why candidates stop at certain points in the recruitment pipeline, helps us understand the differences between successful and unsuccessful effort and which parts of the process can be improved.The recruitment process is transformed once a candidate enters the pipeline. Pay and\\xc2\\xa0benefits can get a great candidate in the door, but the quality and amount of benefits and perks are irrelevant if an employee and an organization\\xe2\\x80\\x99s values don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t align. Employees will not continue to be recruited or stay at an organization where there are cultural differences. In fact,\\xc2\\xa0a Gallup study\\xc2\\xa0found that half of\\xc2\\xa0employees\\xc2\\xa0quit due to bad bosses and cultural fit, so starting with culture helps ensure lasting job satisfaction.While a candidate is evaluating job responsibilities, benefits or even an offer, cultural fit is a critical piece of the puzzle. Culture is even important to millennials who are, according to the Gallup study, not pursuing job satisfaction but rather personal and professional development. Only 29 percent of employed millennials report being fully engaged at work. This has been attributed to millennial attitudes about meaningful work that is enriching and rewarding.I started my career in human resources in campus recruiting and now spend a lot of time on new hire orientation from entry level to partners. We hire over 1,000 employees annually and while I make sure candidates have the technical skills and business acumen we expect, I also assess if their values match ours.By the time a candidate has gone through our recruitment process, they know our firm. Candidates should find that everyone they interact with at the firm shares our values and cultural behavior. This happens because we believe from the C-suite down that culture is crucial \\xe2\\x80\\x94 and experience of it starts early in the recruitment process and continues throughout employment.Cultural credibility is important as well. As HR executives, we play a lead role in ensuring the culture we develop is authentic \\xe2\\x80\\x94 even beyond the ping-pong tables, smoothie machines and in-house yoga classes. We are committed to creating opportunities to engage our people in doing good work.Advancing our culture as a tool for recruitment too provides the opportunity to retain the close-knit collegial culture of a smaller organization. Making a company\\xe2\\x80\\x99s culture a compelling part of our employee value proposition enables organizations to recruit great candidates, act on their feedback and keep the company an attractive, rewarding and exciting place to be.Karleen Mussman is the chief human resources officer with Baker Tilly Virchow Krause and has been with the firm since 2015. \\xc2\\xa9 2017 Workforce Magazine.'],\n",
       " ['SubscribeBack IssuesContributeAdvertisebySarah Fister GaleBesides convenience, texting is a great way to get a sense of a candidate\\xe2\\x80\\x99s personality.Millennials and their Gen Z successors have little time for thoughtfully crafted emails or telephone pleasantries.These digital natives grew up texting and often consider other formats to be cumbersome and outdated. So it should come as no surprise that they think text messages are a completely appropriate way to communicate with recruiters and their future workplace peers.A recent survey from Yello, the talent acquisition software company, shows\\xc2\\xa086 percent of millennials \\xe2\\x80\\x9cfeel positively about text messages being used during the interview period,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d and a similar HeyWire Inc. survey shows 67 percent of employees are using\\xc2\\xa0text\\xc2\\xa0messaging for business-related communications.While it may seem like an overly casual environment to connect with potential hires, texts offer a lot of benefits \\xe2\\x80\\x94 especially in a recruiting setting, said Jason Weingarten, co-founder of the Chicago-based Yello. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cText is faster, it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s easier and it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s more personal,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he said. It can also solve many of problems that create a negative candidate experience, including delays in communication, lack of follow-up and overly generic form letters.\\xe2\\x80\\x9cThere are many points in the recruiting process that are very stressful for candidates,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he said. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cGetting a quick response or update can ease some of that anxiety.\\xe2\\x80\\x9dIt can also be handy for recruits who have another job and don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t want to communicate via their company email or phone, said JoAnne Kruse, chief human resources officer at American Express Global Business Travel. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cThey are lot more responsive via text, and it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s an easy way to move the process forward.\\xe2\\x80\\x9dA Strange BunchBesides convenience, texting is a great way to get a sense of a candidate\\xe2\\x80\\x99s personality, said Jack Barmby, CEO of Gnatta, a customer service software company based in the U.K. His developers and support staff use text messaging to talk to each other and to potential new hires. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cIt is the underpinning of how we communicate,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he said.The company uses Slack, a cloud-based team collaboration tool for its text platform, creating different conversations for different projects, teams and topics. Participants post project updates, questions and comments that others in the group can see and respond to.\\xe2\\x80\\x9cIt\\xe2\\x80\\x99s more efficient than email because users can quickly scroll through posts, find those that are relevant, without getting bogged down in a bunch of \\xe2\\x80\\x98reply-all\\xe2\\x80\\x99 email chains,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he said. There are no formal rules for use, beyond the basics \\xe2\\x80\\x94 don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t be a jerk, and don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t post comments that are not relevant to the topic. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cOtherwise it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s very organic, and we encourage people to let their personalities flourish.\\xe2\\x80\\x9dGnatta also uses it as a vetting tool for new hires. When a candidate makes the hiring short list, they are invited to join one of the casual Slack channels, where Gnatta employees talk about what\\xe2\\x80\\x99s going on in their lives. The recruits get a chance to see how the team communicates, and the team gets a sense of their personality, Barmby said. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cThe \\xe2\\x80\\x98shine\\xe2\\x80\\x99 of the interview comes off, and they have a chance to be themselves.\\xe2\\x80\\x9dInviting candidates to engage via text helps his team determine who will be the best cultural fit for the organization, and it ultimately becomes an extension of the onboarding process. He admitted that some candidates are turned off by the process because it adds a week to the decision, but others love the opportunities to connect with potential peers. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cDevelopers can be a strange bunch, and not everyone is a good fit,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he said. Spending a week chatting with the team is a great way to decide who will fit in.For all its conveniences there also are risks to using texts in recruiting. Companies need to be thoughtful about the information they share via text and how those communications can be tracked, Weingarten said. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cIf you get audited, you need to be able to show the source of the texts, how they were sent, and what messaging you used.\\xe2\\x80\\x9dRecruiters shouldn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t put too many rules around how texting is used. Where recruiters are looking for better, faster and more personal ways to engage with talent, texting is a cheap and familiar solution that can add real value to the process.\\xe2\\x80\\x9cText is the next iteration of how we communicate,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Kruse said. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cIt can be a hugely helpful way to quickly connect with people, is a style that they prefer, so why wouldn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t you take advantage of that?\\xe2\\x80\\x9dSarah Fister Gale is a writer in the Chicago area.

       " ['SubscribeBack IssuesContributeAdvertisebyKris DunnRemember when all you needed to recruit effectively was a basic careers site that had a link to your applicant tracking system and a PDF of the overly aspirational company values designed by your founder that everyone you worked with loved to snicker at?Bonus points if you had stock photos on that career site of a group of seven people (it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s a stock photo), all with perfect teeth and representing just the right amount of diversity as a group.Remember those days? Me too.The proliferation of transparency brought on by social media and workplace-centric solutions like Glassdoor means that candidates can smell a phony company story a mile away.That means if you\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve still got the stock photos and old company values up, as well as offering visitors to your careers site nothing but a listing of jobs, you\\xe2\\x80\\x99re in trouble.That\\xe2\\x80\\x99s why an emerging talent trend in 2017 is recruitment marketing, loosely defined as a collection of services and products designed to help you put your company\\xe2\\x80\\x99s best foot forward to candidates who might want to work for you.Revamp your image using some of the tools in the emerging recruitment marketing suite and candidates will consider your company\\xe2\\x80\\x99s story as more real/authentic/desirable, which translates to increased candidate engagement as well as better conversion in the classic apply/interview/hire recruiting funnel.If you\\xe2\\x80\\x99re new to the recruitment marketing game, here are the things you need to think about to upgrade your careers brand and keep up with the times.Employer value proposition: You\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve probably got company values, right? Not enough these days. Candidates increasingly want to know \\xe2\\x80\\x9cwhat\\xe2\\x80\\x99s in it for me\\xe2\\x80\\x9d (the WIIFM) to work at your company. If you do EVP right, you\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll end up with three to five themes that answer the WIIFM question for your company, which provides structure and direction for where you go with your careers site. You get extra credit if at least one of the themes is borderline negative, because candidates love it when you can be self-reflective.Career site upgrade: Your careers site probably sucks. To remodel, think about wrapping your open jobs with stories and real images from inside your company with laser focus. That focus should be on the aforementioned EVP themes as well as content focused on delivering candidates to your most difficult-to-fill jobs. HR and talent acquisition pros routinely struggle with this advice, but it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s critical that you become selfish related to the space on your careers site \\xe2\\x80\\x94 it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s not HR, it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s marketing. The space and focus is reserved for your recruiting goals, which starts with the hard, not easy-to-fill positions.Your careers site probably sucks. Wrap your open jobs with stories and real images\\xe2\\x80\\xa6 not stock photos.Content is king: The best careers-site strategies deploy a frequently recurring content strategy, meaning you must post a new piece of content at least once a week. That means you should have someone on your team that can interview and write quick-hitting features or find a partner who can. This seems like overkill to some, but stay with me because the careers site is simply where the focused content is stored.Careers social strategy: Once you\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve got a refreshed careers site, it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s time to start thinking social. Many employers make the mistake of simply posting open jobs to social accounts, but that\\xe2\\x80\\x99s not enough. A real careers social strategy emphasizes audience building (gaining followers) and uses the growing social presence to share the fresh content with the world. An important consideration is whether to use the existing corporate social accounts or build stand-alone, careers-focused accounts.Talent tools, email campaigns and marketing chops: Any deep recruitment marketing project undertaken by HR or recruiting is going to morph into things that look like pure marketing. Talent pools, regardless of how they\\xe2\\x80\\x99re captured, are nothing but focused \\xe2\\x80\\x9copt-ins\\xe2\\x80\\x9d to give you the ability to communicate with potential future hires moving forward. Remember that focused content I talked about earlier? We\\xe2\\x80\\x99re doing that content not only to beef up the careers site and have something to share via social, but also to run email marketing campaigns with relevant content. A good email marketing campaign to a talent pool can have an open rate above 50 percent \\xe2\\x80\\x94 something your marketing director would trip her grandmother for.The simple plan of building a better careers site with content that cuts through the clutter, then sharing that content in a systematic way via social and traditional marketing techniques is at the core of any successful recruitment marketing strategy.Do these things well and the candidates will reward you.

The right word combo \\xe2\\x80\\x94\\xc2\\xa0you\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve got all my attention.An expert contends there are 150 unconscious biases in play at our brain at any given time. Technology can nudge hiring managers to align with the company\\xe2\\x80\\x99s diversity and inclusion goals.For instance, I ran across The Only Way to Beat Unconscious Biases in the Workplace a few days ago.

Hint: It has nothing to do with the user experience and everything to do with what the author called, the nudge.Apparently when the idea of relieving HR processes of bias comes up, technology system decision-makers in the market at-large are often peppered with questions about whether they plan to replace HR with artificial intelligence. I\\xe2\\x80\\x99d wager, aside from companies firmly entrenched in the tech industry, few organizations have any such plan, but I agree with one idea presented in the piece: It pays to take a holistic look at HR, with innovations like machine learning as one facet to consider. You don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t want to lose the human touch, nor do you want to cut HR leaders off from the rich data streams technology provides. Data they can use to make better, more sustainable recruitment and talent-related decisions.But it was the suggestion that CDOs are poorly positioned in the HR decision-making hierarchy that really caught my eye. Patti Fletcher, leadership futurist and solution management at\\xc2\\xa0SAP SuccessFactors, \\xe2\\x80\\x9csaid that while chief diversity officers are on the rise, that hasn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t necessarily translated into measurable results \\xe2\\x80\\xa6 designated diversity leaders rarely have a seat at the table when it comes to human capital management technology purchasing decisions.\\xe2\\x80\\x9dTechnology is ubiquitous in the modern workplace. Successful organizations have made gadgetry another kind of employee in areas throughout the employee lifecycle. Talent leaders of all kinds rely on systems to do their jobs: hiring, recruitment, retention, engagement, promotion, succession planning, etc. If diversity leaders can\\xe2\\x80\\x99t influence technology purchasing decisions in the context of talent or people strategy, that\\xe2\\x80\\x99s a huge disconnect.It also brings up a few questions:But back to the nudge. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cWe know the blame and shame game doesn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t work when it comes to addressing bias,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Fletcher. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cWe\\xe2\\x80\\x99re finding out what does work is the nudge factor. There are 150 unconscious biases in play at our brain at any given time, and technology can literally interrupt decisions, nudging hiring managers to align with the company\\xe2\\x80\\x99s diversity and inclusion goals.\\xe2\\x80\\x9dGood grief. How can there be 150 unconscious biases in our brains at any given time? That\\xe2\\x80\\x99s just, wow. They can\\xe2\\x80\\x99t mean all at once. I couldn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t name that many biases if you paid me. But if you ever had a doubt that you have been or will at some point fall prey to bias, that number should give you significant pause.\\xe2\\x80\\x9cThis is not about replaying the old human vs. machine tapes,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Fletcher explained. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cWhen technology can take everything about someone \\xe2\\x80\\x94\\xc2\\xa0credentials, experience, cultural fit \\xe2\\x80\\x94\\xc2\\xa0and find the ideal match based on what the machine has learned about what it takes to be successful at your business, this fundamentally changes the role of HR.\\xe2\\x80\\x9dAnd it goes without saying, it makes things more complicated. That\\xe2\\x80\\x99s why it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s so important that diversity and talent leaders work together to untangle the best ways to find, assess, keep and promote talent. Diversity, inclusion and talent are not ideas that can be kept separate. If these silos exist, I bet that organization\\xe2\\x80\\x99s diversity plan is more of an idea than it is a strategy. Unless diversity is a sop, which is infinitely worse.Whether it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s using technology to promote the nudge, being more thoughtful about the wording in job postings, or any of the other hundred HR-diversity related tasks leaders face each day \\xe2\\x80\\x94\\xc2\\xa0lean on the people who have made diversity and inclusion their business. Pick their brains. Ask their opinion. Loop them in. If you have a diversity leader, that\\xe2\\x80\\x99s what they\\xe2\\x80\\x99re there for. If you don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t use them as a resource, what\\xe2\\x80\\x99s the point?Kellye Whitney is associate editorial director for Workforce.

What if we said, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cLet\\xe2\\x80\\x99s accept and work with attrition rather than against it?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d To do that, we must first understand what causes turnover in startups.In my experience, the cause is due to two key factors: the profile of people who are attracted to work at startups, and evolution of that profile as the company grows.The profile of candidates who flock to startups tend to be more risk-tolerant professionals interested in making a big impact, and they\\xe2\\x80\\x99re focused on growing quickly. Because successful startups go through various phases of growth, the type of person interested in contributing at one stage is different from the one attracted to the next stage.For example, at an earlier stage, a startup will typically attract highly creative, strategic, future-oriented thinkers who defy boundaries. As it grows in number of employees, processes are needed to help create structure, which changes the kind of work needed, hence changing the candidates the company attracts.It is up to HR to understand this evolution and work with the reality rather than against it. Working to \\xe2\\x80\\x9cprevent\\xe2\\x80\\x9d turnover is virtually impossible, and leads only to great frustration and wasted resources. Instead, here are three strategies to work with the reality we live in:The purpose here is not to say that engaging employees and ensuring overall employee health and happiness isn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t important. In fact, it is extremely important. However, at the pace that startups grow, the reality is that different people are attracted to, and do their best in, different stages. So, instead of wringing our hands over attrition and trying to coerce everyone to stay, let\\xe2\\x80\\x99s capitalize on the fact that each individual performs differently depending on the situation by changing how we attract and develop talent each step of the way.Rachel Ernst is the head of employee success at Reflektive.

AARP rolled out its new job board for, well, older people. Seniors. Users and members of AARP. Mature people \\xe2\\x80\\xa6 like me.Michelle Hoffman, the products and platforms director, work and jobs, at AARP, gave me a brief online tour on Day 2 of SHRM\\xe2\\x80\\x99s Talent Management Conference & Exposition. Understandably since the site launched just six weeks ago, it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s relatively thin. Employers have yet to discover it. But there is content, and enough to see that this could be a really valuable tool for older job seekers and those looking to add workers with years, if not decades of experience.In fact, the topic of workers over 50 randomly popped up during Tim Sackett\\xe2\\x80\\x99s excellent presentation on diversity and inclusion earlier in the day.\\xe2\\x80\\x9cIf you\\xe2\\x80\\x99re over 50 you\\xe2\\x80\\x99re crap,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Sackett sarcastically said of clueless employers. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cThey want 27-year-olds with 20 years of experience.\\xe2\\x80\\x9dAs empty nesters, 50-plus workers have more capacity and bandwidth to do a good job, Sackett said. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cInstead they want to hire that 30-year-old who has sick kids.\\xe2\\x80\\x9dA D&I issue? Absolutely.But back to AARP\\xe2\\x80\\x99s job board. The last of the old-school job boards was also at the conference. Rumors continue to swirl regarding CareerBuilder\\xe2\\x80\\x99s sale.

And, for better or worse, I am in charge of it.Perhaps like you, the internship program is collateral duty for me; in other words, it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s another responsibility among many.I enjoy it, though. We have had some wonderfully bright young minds pass through the cubicles at Human Capital Media, and they continually surprise me with their talents and abilities.So it was with more than a passing interest that I attended a session on internships during the opening day of SHRM\\xe2\\x80\\x99s Talent Management Conference & Exposition, which is conveniently being held in the Hyatt Regency Chicago \\xe2\\x80\\x94 right next door to HCM World Headquarters. I wanted to see if I was getting the most out of our program, and if we were providing a valuable experience for our eager young journalists in training.I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m happy to report that yes, our program seems to be on par with what others around the country are doing. Sharon Beaudry, an assistant professor at the Oregon Institute of Technology in Klamath Falls, led the session titled, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cTomorrow\\xe2\\x80\\x99s Talent in Your Hands Today: Developing a Robust Internship Program for a Win-Win Result.\\xe2\\x80\\x9dBeaudry, who spent two decades in HR and now is in academia, had a good handle on developing and maintaining a good internship program. One of the key points she made to the room of 100 or so HR practitioners was eerily parent-like: \\xe2\\x80\\x9cThey listen to you, not us.\\xe2\\x80\\x9dWhich is true. I occasionally [ahem] go on these long-winded philosophical diatribes with the interns regarding all manner of journalist-ing.

Our interns are involved in staff meetings, companywide events and sit smack-dab in the midst of the editors.We try to offer ongoing, continuous supervision, although I like to let them think for themselves, too.Unfortunately Beaudry\\xe2\\x80\\x99s presentation ran long, leaving no time for Q&A. A couple of people offered thoughts during her talk, but it would have been a great opportunity \\xe2\\x80\\x94 for me, anyway \\xe2\\x80\\x94 to hear what others are doing with their interns.Outside of paying $17.69 an hour, that is.\\xc2\\xa0Odds and ends \\xe2\\x80\\xa6 It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s fairly common to hear HR people say \\xe2\\x80\\x9cthat\\xe2\\x80\\x99s inside baseball\\xe2\\x80\\x9d when someone is talking about the minutiae of some program or practice.

Fletcher is an agent for a number of major league players and coaches, and her stories and anecdotes got the conference of to a great start, although for the non-seamheads, it might have been a too little inside baseball.A new term to add to your HR bingo board: Geo-fencing was a new one on me.

I wouldn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t know. I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m not looking for a job, and I don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t know anyone who is, which is interesting. Because I know quite a few people who are jobless.Why? A variety of reasons. Layoffs, bad bosses, health issues, whatever the reason, they should be looking for work. But to a man, their \\xe2\\x80\\x9csearch,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d well, let\\xe2\\x80\\x99s just say it deserves those air quotes.I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve asked why, and again, to a man, their responses are some variation on the following: You couldn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t pay me to look for another job, and let these folks treat me any old kind of way. Um, OK. So it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s more important that you be treated well \\xc2\\xa0than it is to find a job?Their response: Basically? Yeah. Out of necessity small, home-based businesses are popping, there\\xe2\\x80\\x99s long-term temping, dedicated freelancing, there are all kinds of hustles out there keeping good workers out of traditional offices.Of course, when I hear stories like these I ask for details.

She thought she was in until that last one. The man interviewing her wouldn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t meet her eye, and he was looking pained. He also kept sighing and rubbing his head.She said she knew it was over at that point. Weeks went by and she heard nothing. She finally called them and was told some vague variation of \\xe2\\x80\\x9cwe\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve gone in another direction.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\xe2\\x80\\x9cWell, thanks for sharing,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d I scoffed.\\xe2\\x80\\x9cMr. Crusoe, I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m concerned about this 20 year gap in your resume.\\xe2\\x80\\x9dShe nodded. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cYup. That\\xe2\\x80\\x99s what I thought too.\\xe2\\x80\\x9dAnother lady told me she was up for a great job. Her first phone screen went well. The second one went even better. Then she showed up for the in-person interview. She was kept waiting for almost an hour with no explanation or apology, and when a man came out he looked at her with feigned surprise and said, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cYou\\xe2\\x80\\x99re [fill in first and last name here]?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\xe2\\x80\\x9cHe wasn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t even the person I was there to meet.

I said, \\xe2\\x80\\x98I sure am,\\xe2\\x80\\x99 and I held up my phone. \\xe2\\x80\\x98And I just found out I got a fabulous job. Bye!\\xe2\\x80\\x99 I should have won an Oscar. Buzzards. Wasting my time, making me put on my good clothes and spend money traveling to deal with stupid ****. They weren\\xe2\\x80\\x99t getting another minute from me.\\xe2\\x80\\x9dShe has since suspended her search altogether and is now happily enrolled in beauty school. She\\xe2\\x80\\x99s been doing hair on the side for years and figured she was doing well, why not make it official? She likes being her own boss, she said. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cAnd I always treat my customers right.\\xe2\\x80\\x9dBoth\\xc2\\xa0stories are examples of how talented employees are choosing to vote with their feet and take themselves out of the talent pool because companies are not ready or willing to treat them with respect. It doesn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t make sense.The phrase war for talent is a little dated, but it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s definitely still valid. Companies have tons of unfilled positions, and I know there are a good number of qualified, hardworking people out there who would love to fill them; I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve worked with the Oscar winner/stylist before, and she\\xe2\\x80\\x99s sharp as a tack, professional and dedicated. It was definitely their loss.The problem is, the recruiting process is broken. Whether it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s a sign of the times, the result of technology and the rapid pace of business edging out common courtesy and common sense, recruiters aren\\xe2\\x80\\x99t always what they should be.I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve heard them described as careless, rude\\xe2\\x80\\x94\\xc2\\xa0how would you like to go to an interview in your best clothes and be called by the wrong name or be asked were you there for the housekeeping position?\\xe2\\x80\\x94\\xc2\\xa0and completely unprepared. And what\\xe2\\x80\\x99s with the weeks going by without telling people whether or not they got the job? Even a form letter-type email is better than silence. Close the loop already. Don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t just leave people hanging.Recently my boss sent our intern candidates \\xe2\\x80\\x94\\xc2\\xa0interns \\xe2\\x80\\x94\\xc2\\xa0who didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t get the post an email within days of us making the decision. And that\\xe2\\x80\\x99s standard practice for him. So, talent leaders? Y\\xe2\\x80\\x99all may need to ask yourselves, what is our recruiting process/experience really like?If you have unfilled positions and you\\xe2\\x80\\x99re spending a lot of time and money recruiting and interviewing with no results, something\\xe2\\x80\\x99s not right. Determine:Those are just a few questions to get you started. The actual recruiting process analysis will need to be much more in depth, and correcting any problems will be an even bigger job. But it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s a job worth doing. Further, you need to ask these questions of the right people \\xe2\\x80\\x94\\xc2\\xa0the candidates.The best time to ask is right after the interview when the experience is fresh in their minds. Of course, who\\xe2\\x80\\x99s going to answer honestly when they\\xe2\\x80\\x99re still holding out hope of getting the gig? The next best time would be after they\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve been notified in the negative. Shoot them an email. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s kind of like an exit interview.I think companies should send in the job-seeker version of secret shoppers. Send in fake candidates of all shapes, colors and sizes with stunning resumes and see what happens. It might save some serious recruiting costs in the long-run by rooting out systemic bias and other institutionalized missteps. And anytime you sweep out the bad\\xe2\\x80\\x94\\xc2\\xa0assuming the company fixes what is broken \\xe2\\x80\\x94\\xc2\\xa0you make way for something good.And good in the recruiting game means talent.Kellye Whitney is associate editorial director for Workforce.

       " ['SubscribeBack IssuesContributeAdvertisebyMia ManciniRecruiters need to track their recruiting conversion funnel.Recruiting software provider Lever recently conducted hiring research that collected data from more than 600 small- and medium-sized businesses for over a year. The data was collected to help \\xe2\\x80\\x9cstartups and SMBs understand whether what they\\xe2\\x80\\x99re seeing unfold in their hiring practices is typical,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Amanda Bell, director of recruiting at San Francisco-based Lever.According to Bell, a data-driven recruiter analyzes their recruiting-conversion funnel. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cThis is how many candidates are making it from the top of your pipeline to a screen, from a screen to an onsite interview, and so on. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s the information you need to spot inefficiencies in your process and understand what benchmarks to hold your team accountable to,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Bell.Among the findings is that 31 percent of candidates decline their offers. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cAs a recruiter, by the time you extend a candidate an offer, you\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve invested substantial time in them. You\\xe2\\x80\\x99re emotionally invested too, so it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s tough if they say no,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Bell, whose company promotes a 50-50 gender balance among its 92 employees. Companies should be aware that it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s normal for almost one in every three candidates to turn their offer down, and then take steps to curb that as much as possible.The research showed only 17 percent of candidates make it to the first stage and 32 percent of screened candidates make it to the on-site interview stage.\\xe2\\x80\\x9cThis data is a useful benchmark for a recruiting leader at a small company,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Bell. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cIf the conversion rate dips, it means my recruiters are spending too much time on candidates that don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t meet the bar \\xe2\\x80\\xa6 and time is our most precious commodity.\\xe2\\x80\\x9dThe significance behind hire rates is candidate-to-hire ratio, said Bell. Knowing the right number of candidates needed at the top of the funnel maximizes chances of making a hire. The research showed SMBs go through an average of 120 engineering candidates to make one hire. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cUnless your ratios are meaningfully better, if you\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve only filled your pipeline with 80 engineering candidates, you risk needing to start your search back at square one,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Bell.Data revealed it takes 86 candidates from all sources for every hire, but far fewer employee referrals \\xe2\\x80\\x94 just 12 \\xe2\\x80\\x94 to make one hire. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cOne in every 64 proactively sourced candidates is hired, which proves the importance of candidate sourcing as a core component of a proactive talent strategy,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Bell. Combining sourcing and referrals is important for hitting aggressive hiring targets.Referrals get hired at high rates, so they represent a small percentage of the candidate pool, but much larger percentage of total hires. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cWhen comparing benchmarks to companies like Lyft, which has seen employee referrals account for as high as 40 percent of hires \\xe2\\x80\\x94 startups and SMBs realize it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s worthwhile keeping the focus on employee referrals high,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Bell.Bell recommends tracking conversion rates, offer-acceptance rates, hire ratios and time to hire. In addition to knowing these metrics, the most efficient way to leverage recruiting data is to understand how the processes vary by role.\\xe2\\x80\\x9cInvest in the right places by knowing the most efficient sources of hire,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Bell.According to Bell, create an inclusive culture by asking the right questions that will evaluate talent based on their work abilities. Know what you\\xe2\\x80\\x99re looking for\\xc2\\xa0before\\xc2\\xa0you go into an interview. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cThis allows you to ask candidates similar questions for fair comparison and reduces bias through objective decision-making,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Bell.After making an offer, special touches are helpful.\\xe2\\x80\\x9cAt Lever, we\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve pulled all sorts of crazy stunts to make sure our offerees feel valued, like shipping a travel care package to a candidate who was about to head to Australia on vacation.

       " ['SubscribeBack IssuesContributeAdvertisebySarah Fister GaleSnagajob is one of those companies that solves a problem no one else seemed to notice \\xe2\\x80\\x94 how to quickly match hourly workers with the employers who need them.In 2015,\\xc2\\xa078.2\\xc2\\xa0million workers in the United States held hourly jobs, representing\\xc2\\xa0more than half\\xc2\\xa0of the national workforce. And as more people turn to hourly jobs to supplement their salaries or piece together a working income, these numbers likely will grow. Yet online recruiting sites mostly ignored this segment of the workforce, said Snagajob CEO Peter Harrison. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cThere is an inherent bias against these kinds of jobs,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he said.\\xe2\\x80\\x9cWith the growth of the on-demand economy, we think there will be a substantial tailwind in this segment,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d says Habib Kairouz, managing partner of New York-based Rho Capital Partners, which led a $100 million investment in Snagajob last year.The Arlington, Virginia-based recruiting technology company provides a platform specifically designed to link low-wage hourly workers with employers, primarily via a mobile app that lets them apply for openings in a few clicks.\\xe2\\x80\\x9cRecruiting hourly workers requires a different set of processes and tools,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Harrison said. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cEmployers aren\\xe2\\x80\\x99t looking for extensive resumes and experience. They are concerned about location, availability and attitude.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d At the same time, hourly workers want a quick, easy way to find and apply for jobs and get to work.Snagajob was built to address these needs. It began as an hourly job board in 2000, but expanded over the years, adding testing features, tracking tools and its mobile app. Then in July 2016 it acquired PeopleMatter, an end-to-end talent and workforce management platform, adding training, scheduling and performance management features to its site.The platform now has more than 75 million registered workers and 300,000 employer locations, and filled 3.5 million jobs last year \\xe2\\x80\\x94 almost entirely via the app.\\xe2\\x80\\x9cIt\\xe2\\x80\\x99s the largest marketplace for hourly workers out there and they have already made the hiring process much smoother,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Kairouz said. Because it has such a broad employer and employee base, his team believe it is well-positioned to maintain a leadership position in the space. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cInnovation is always easier when you have an existing base of customers.\\xe2\\x80\\x9dThough the most exciting thing about Snagajob is the potential of a new pilot project, which will let employees apply for occasional shifts at a variety of companies. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cWe see it as an opportunity to be on the forefront of the work-on-demand trend,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Harrison.Through the pilot, employees register to be considered for shift work, then notify Snagajob when they are available. So far the company has seen a 98 percent fill rate on open shifts in the first minute of posting, Harrison said.They are still working out some challenges, like how quickly workers need to arrive, who ultimately employs and pays them and how to best match candidates with positions. But Harrison believes once these issues are addressed, the Snagashift model will be a game changer. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cThere is a tremendous appetite for this kind of service.\\xe2\\x80\\x9dSnagajob Chief Operating Officer Jocelyn Mangan agrees. The shift work approach fills a need for employers, who often to scramble to fill shifts when workers quit or call in sick, and for workers to bolster their income without making a big commitment to any one job, she said. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cIt\\xe2\\x80\\x99s a great way for them to grab a few hours of work and get paid whenever they have the time,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said the former OpenTable chief product and marketing officer.Snagashift is just another way the company can accommodate the needs of the young and mobile workforce \\xe2\\x80\\x94 and the companies that hire them, Kairouz added.\\xe2\\x80\\x9cThirty years from now it could be the way all hourly workers find work,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he said.Sarah Fister Gale is a writer based in the Chicago area.

As executive vice president of human resources for SAP, she is responsible for overseeing SAP\\xe2\\x80\\x99s largest organizational unit, Global Customer Operations. She joined SAP in 2002 as Director of Total Rewards for North America. Prior to this, she was the head of human resources for the U.S. and the North America GCO team. She works closely with global HR colleagues to ensure SAP\\xe2\\x80\\x99s programs meet the needs of millions of employees. Her passion about building progressive cultures drives her focus on talent acquisition, people development and leadership. Workforce intern Mia Mancini caught up with McInnis-Day via email to discuss her unique insight on what 2017 will hold from a hiring perspective.Workforce: What are your thoughts on hiring trends for the year ahead?\\xc2\\xa0Brigette McInnis-Day: The competition for top talent is increasing, forcing hiring managers to alter their traditional approach to hiring. I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m seeing the hiring process become more social. Senior level executives are joining in on the hiring front, turning to using word-of-mouth at every opportunity. Companies are offering incentives to employees that bring in strong talent. Another trend I am seeing is hiring managers considering former employees as potential candidates.WF: Why will the interview process become more obsolete?McInnis-Day: It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s more about it becoming about the candidate experience. Hiring and interviewing has traditionally been a daunting process. It is important to focus on the total candidate and management experience. By streamlining the process, we can keep the interview cycles shorter and more efficient.WF: How are companies like Uber changing the way human resource managers approach the hiring process?McInnis-Day: Companies like Uber are moving the entire hiring process online. As more employees continue to put an emphasis on convenience and flexibility, we should make the hiring process reflect this. The online interview process may not work for all types of candidates. Hiring for a position where the candidate will need to interact regularly with people in your organization as a leader, you\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll likely want to meet them in-person to gauge their people skills.WF: Why and how are employees getting jobs without a formal interview?McInnis-Day: We streamline the process and cut down on unnecessary steps. We have a targeted approach \\xe2\\x80\\x93 we know what gaps we have in our organization, what skills are needed to fill those gaps and then we go out and find it. Gone are the days of needing 10 interviews to fill a single role. Effectively utilizing connected technologies to inform hiring decisions will increase the experience.WF: How do you execute SAP\\xe2\\x80\\x99s approach around diversity?McInnis-Day: We want the best talent, people who demonstrate long-term potential, will drive better business outcomes and challenge the way we think. We have a strong corporate backing when it comes to facilitating change and ensuring workplace equality. We set a goal to have women in 25 percent of all managerial positions by 2017 \\xe2\\x80\\x93 not only have we succeeded in this goal, I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m proud to say we\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve surpassed it. We ensured that our succession planning guarantees that potential leaders can be promoted from within SAP.WF: How do you encourage employees to determine ways in which they can add more value?McInnis-Day: I always push my employees to be their best selves every day. Managers should be able to glean a strong understanding of an employee\\xe2\\x80\\x99s best attributes and where they excel. Challenging employees is another way leaders can ensure we are bringing the most value out of our teams. I am constantly challenging my employees to not only think outside the box, but to think big.WF: Explain how the need for more specialists (from a skills perspective) will impact the number of temporary workers.McInnis-Day: There\\xe2\\x80\\x99s an obvious trend happening \\xe2\\x80\\x93 the gig economy is growing. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s unrealistic to think that every person will be good at every task, yet we as a whole need to be experts at everything. As customer expectations become more demanding, we can react by hiring temporary specialists to help work on specific products.WF: What are the most important skills hiring managers will look for in their employees?McInnis-Day: It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s not only about who has the right set of skills and competencies, but also on who has the right attitude, values and aspirations. The best talent is people who not only meet the job requirements on paper, but that go beyond and embody a company\\xe2\\x80\\x99s core set of values. HR executives are putting an increasing amount of weight on whether a candidate is a cultural fit for the company. This increases company morale and ensures that the employee is content. On my teams, I value transparency, honesty and integrity.WF: If you could give one piece of advice to those interviewing for jobs, what would it be? McInnis-Day: It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s all about showing what you can bring to the table that your competition may not. Highlight what makes you different from everyone else. Your personal experiences can show your passion for the work you will be doing, but also your personality and give the interviewer a chance to see if you will fit into the company culture.Mia Mancini is a Workforce intern.

       " ['SubscribeBack IssuesContributeAdvertisebySarah Fister GaleGamification is helping companies curb unconscious bias from recruiting.Consumer goods maker Unilever announced the launch of a new digital recruitment program that will use gamification to eliminate unconscious bias from its hiring process. The technology, unveiled in September, mixes gaming elements with video interviews to identify the best candidates among its 250,000 annual graduate applicants, said Leena Nair,\\xc2\\xa0chief HR officer for\\xc2\\xa0Unilever.\\xe2\\x80\\x9cIt is hoped that this innovative approach will help us attract new talent to the company,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Nair said in a statement.This trend, which promises to make every aspect of the talent development experience \\xe2\\x80\\x9cfun and engaging!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d has led to a surge of new tools, vendor platforms, and social features across the HR tech platform, from recruiting through training, performance management and succession planning. It is important to note that gamification is not the same as gaming, said Kyle Lagunas, analyst for IDC.\\xe2\\x80\\x9cIt\\xe2\\x80\\x99s not about turning work or job applications into games,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he said. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cIt\\xe2\\x80\\x99s about leveraging game mechanics for other use cases.\\xe2\\x80\\x9dFor example, a status bar letting candidates know where they are in the application process is a gaming mechanic, as is giving employees points or badges for submitting good referrals. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cThe end goal is to incentivize a certain behavior through these technologies,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he said.Unilever joins a number of global brands including Google, Uber, Marriott, and Deloitte\\xc2\\xa0, using gamification in their recruiting strategy in an effort to increase candidate engagement, shorten screening time, and build brand awareness. Though using it to eliminate bias is somewhat new.The platform invites candidates to play a series of games that allow\\xc2\\xa0Unilever\\xc2\\xa0to gain insight into their skills and potential, which may not show up on a r\\xc3\\xa9sum\\xc3\\xa9. It also gives them a sense of how well the candidates \\xe2\\x80\\x9cconnect with the company\\xe2\\x80\\x99s goals and purpose.\\xe2\\x80\\x9dNair called it a \\xe2\\x80\\x9ctruly interactive experience\\xe2\\x80\\x9d that will allow the company to connect with applicants in a more meaningful way.Dishwasher Hired in Coding ChallengeIt\\xe2\\x80\\x99s an interesting spin on a difficult problem that recruiters and hiring managers struggle to address. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cThe challenge with bias is that most people don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t realize they are doing it,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Vivek Ravisankar, co-founder of HackerRank, a tech talent recruiting platform that uses coding challenges to assess candidates\\xe2\\x80\\x99 skills rather than r\\xc3\\xa9sum\\xc3\\xa9s.Bias isn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t just limited to racial or gender issues. It can extend to what schools a hiring manager thinks are relevant, where a candidate is from and what past experience they have. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cWe are drawn to people who are like us,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he said. That can subconsciously impact hiring decisions, leading managers to dismiss the most skilled candidates in preference for someone more familiar, or to leave the job open. Ravisankar notes that unconscious bias has led to the myth that talented developers are impossible to find. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cWhen you eliminate bias and just look at a candidates skills, you\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll find there are a lot more options.\\xe2\\x80\\x9dRavisankar shared the story of a former dishwasher who taught himself to code on the side but was repeatedly rejected by companies because of his non-traditional career path \\xe2\\x80\\x94 until he completed a HackerRank challenge for VMware, the virtualization software subsidiary of Dell.\\xe2\\x80\\x9cHe did great on the challenge and got the job,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Ravisankar reports. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cIt\\xe2\\x80\\x99s a great example of someone who was repeatedly rejected in every r\\xc3\\xa9sum\\xc3\\xa9 screen but now works for a Fortune 500 company.\\xe2\\x80\\x9dGamification can also be used to challenge decisions made by recruiters and hiring managers to further drive bias out of the process, Lagunas said. For example, having recruiters and managers rate candidates with a five-star tool that requires them to provide justification for low ratings. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cThey can\\xe2\\x80\\x99t just say \\xe2\\x80\\x98poor culture fit,\\xe2\\x80\\x99 \\xe2\\x80\\x9d he said. Instead they are prompted to explain how that candidate doesn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t align with the core pillars of the company\\xe2\\x80\\x99s culture. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cPeople often use \\xe2\\x80\\x98culture fit\\xe2\\x80\\x99 as an excuse not to hire someone. This use of gamification challenges that excuse.\\xe2\\x80\\x9dBut technology alone, no matter how fun or engaging, will not solve the entire problem of bias, Lagunas said. While these tools help companies look beyond the r\\xc3\\xa9sum\\xc3\\xa9, managers still need to be aware of their internal biases when making final hiring decisions. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cThe biggest hurdle is admitting we all have them,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he said. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cYou have to embrace your bias before you can find a solution.\\xe2\\x80\\x9dSarah Fister Gale is a writer living in the Chicago area.\\xc2\\xa9 2017 Workforce Magazine.'],\n",
       " ['SubscribeBack IssuesContributeAdvertisebySarah Fister GaleBig companies are increasingly relying on recruitment process outsourcing as part of a strategic approach to recruiting that allows them to tap best-in-class technology, top recruiting talent and advanced performance metrics.This is good news for RPO vendors, who\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve seen their businesses steadily grow. But it has also put them on the hook to provide an increasingly sophisticated set of tools and services to keep these clients engaged.Today\\xe2\\x80\\x99s RPO customers want their vendors to do more than just fill seats, said Stacey Cadigan, principal consultant for Information Services Group, a market intelligence firm. They are looking to them to build their employment brand, increase passive candidate engagement and improve personalization in the application process without losing efficiency.\\xe2\\x80\\x9cThose services used to be differentiators,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Cadigan said. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cNow they are expected.\\xe2\\x80\\x9dRPO vendors are responding. In recent years they\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve added a variety of recruiting technologies to drive engagement and brand awareness for clients, including digital marketing tools, video interviewing, and mobile job application and follow-up features. They are also working with clients in a consulting capacity, adding \\xe2\\x80\\x9cbrand specialists\\xe2\\x80\\x9d who work with clients to help them highlight their brand message across all of their candidate touchpoints.\\xe2\\x80\\x9cBranding has become such a critical part of the RPO delivery model,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Cadigan said. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cIt filters into every aspect of the recruiting process.\\xe2\\x80\\x9dThe Challenge: Merging Good and FastClients may want a more robust suite of services from their RPO providers, but that doesn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t mean they are letting go of the key performance metrics that drive this business model. Time to hire and cost to hire are still key measures of RPO success, said Dan Oakes, senior vice president and general manager of Randstad\\xe2\\x80\\x99s RPO business in North America. That\\xe2\\x80\\x99s forcing vendors to juggle sometimes competing demands to create a personalized and engaging candidate experience that is also fully automated to increase efficiency.\\xe2\\x80\\x9cThe challenge is how to best combine the technology and the human experience,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Oakes said.One way Randstad is addressing this issue is by developing more complex talent community tools that proactively seek out and engage passive talent, so they are already warm when a position becomes available. It is similar to a talent community, but rather than passively storing data on anyone who applies, they seek out specific kinds of talent and sort them according to skills and experience, Oakes said. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cIt will help us get candidates to the client as fast as possible.\\xe2\\x80\\x9dClients also are giving up on their desire to see proof that the RPO is meeting deadlines and cutting costs. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cAnalytics are a big part of that,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Oakes said. Most RPOs have rolled out a variety of analytics tools including dashboards and weekly reports to track candidate status and other measures. Though Oakes admitted, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cNo one has really mastered it yet.\\xe2\\x80\\x9dHe would like to see the industry get to the point where data is available in real time, and appears as a tickertape running along the bottom of his screen showing constant performance updates. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cWe aren\\xe2\\x80\\x99t there yet.\\xe2\\x80\\x9dPart of the challenge is the disparate data sets. Much of the data that would provide recruiters with insight into where the best hires come from and the best ways to engage them live inside the company\\xe2\\x80\\x99s applicant tracking system or HR management system. Without that data, it can be hard for RPOs to make connections between past successes and future hires.This challenge is further complicated by the increasing use of contingent labor, said Stephen Clancy, director of workforce strategies for Staffing Industry Analysts. The company\\xe2\\x80\\x99s data shows contingent workers represented 29 percent of all U.S. workers in 2015, representing $792 billion in staffing buyer spend.\\xe2\\x80\\x9cThe penetration of contingent labor is pushing recruiting trends toward total talent management,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he said. That means RPO vendors need to get more creative in the way they source and engage candidates, leverage their networks and keep track of talent once these contracts have ended. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cIt is generating a lot of debate about the role RPOs play in finding contingent talent.\\xe2\\x80\\x9dInside Intel: Adapt to Contingent Labor TrendsMost RPOs aren\\xe2\\x80\\x99t yet integrated into the total talent management process, but Clancy predicts they will move in that direction as contingent labor becomes a bigger part of the workforce. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cRPOs need to think about how they are going to innovate to take advantage of this \\xe2\\x80\\x98known talent\\xe2\\x80\\x99 pool,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he said.He believes that the vendors who figure out how to integrate contract labor into the broader recruiting and talent management program will gain a competitive edge going forward.In the meantime, clients should continue to push their vendors to deliver more robust analytics around their recruiting efforts, and keep track of all the talent that moves though the organization, Cadigan said. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cClients should expect their RPOs to innovate, and to provide real-time data to support the decisions they make on their clients\\xe2\\x80\\x99 behalf.\\xe2\\x80\\x9dSarah Fister Gale is a writer based in the Chicago area.

That includes fleshing out company websites with \\xe2\\x80\\x9cday in the life\\xe2\\x80\\x9d videos, employee testimonies, executive blogs and detailed job descriptions, and adding branded language to all applicant communications. They are also expanding their social media presence to appeal to passive candidates through blogs, photos and posts that highlight the company culture and values rather than just referencing job openings.This proactive approach helps them attract a better candidate pool, and begin to win over hard-to-find talent before they ever engage with a recruiter. This is particularly important among highly skilled millennials who choose the companies they want to work for long before they apply for the job, Hasting said.The Challenge: Close the Onboarding GapOnce candidates are recruited, companies are also looking for ways to link the recruiting process more directly to onboarding and talent management as a way to better engage new employees and track performance, said Holger Mueller, principal analyst and vice president at Constellation Research. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cIt\\xe2\\x80\\x99s the natural next step for recruiting,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he said.Many talent management software vendors have some onboarding tools, like Silkroad\\xe2\\x80\\x99s RedCarpet, Oracle\\xe2\\x80\\x99s Talent Cloud and Cornerstone On Demand\\xe2\\x80\\x99s ResCare. They all address administrative tasks pretty well, but customers want them to do more, said Rowan. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cOnboarding is an opportunity to socialize new hires, introduce them to teammates, and get them connected on internal social platforms,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d she said.Over the past 18 months, vendors have been scrambling to make their onboarding tools more robust, she said. SuccessFactors for example, integrated its social platform Jam into the onboarding suite and links new hires directly to learning, goal setting and other talent management tools; CRM vendor Avature offers clients a customizable onboarding portal where new employees can connect with managers and teammates before their first day. Rowan believes this category of recruiting software still has room to improve.Mueller noted that the link between recruiting and the broader talent management programs is also driving demand for more sophisticated workforce analytics. They want to know things like where their best hires come from, what skills and education they bring to the table and why they leave when they do.The challenge is not the lack of tools, it is lack of access to the data, which often sits in a siloed system. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cCompanies need better data to do better analytics,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he said. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cThe only way to get that information is if the recruiting data is merged with the rest of the talent management system.\\xe2\\x80\\x9dInsider Intel: HR and Recruiting Need to Get Along\\xc2\\xa0Mueller urges HR leaders to look for vendors that can help them link recruiting, onboarding and the broader talent management system, and to create stronger links between HR and recruiting so that data is more easily captured and shared.\\xe2\\x80\\x9cThere is a big disconnect right now between recruiting and performance management,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he said. But if companies want to track their high performers and replicate them in future hires, they need to close this gap.Companies also need to think more strategically about branding and what their social persona looks like, Hasting added. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cWhether you want candidates to think you are innovative, or fun, or professional, that has to come across in all of\\xc2\\xa0 your marketing and branding efforts,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Hasting said, and the more proactive they are the better. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cIf you want to go after passive talent, you have to build a brand that will capture their interest long before they apply for the job.\\xe2\\x80\\x9dSarah Fister Gale is a writer based in the Chicago area.

There are just two levels \\xe2\\x80\\x94 leadership and the people who report to them.The purpose of this is to empower the people we hire to make decisions and move quicker.We\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve also taken steps to increase transparency within the company. People used to be afraid to speak up about any bad news, so they often just agreed to do what was told, even if it simply wasn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t going to happen.We have improved on our ability to communicate both good and bad news. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s hard to fix something if you don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t know what the issues are, and it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s important to know what can and can\\xe2\\x80\\x99t be done so we can all work toward a solution.On the other hand, people also need to know that they\\xe2\\x80\\x99re making progress and that what they\\xe2\\x80\\x99re doing is headed in the right direction. Celebrating success both small and large is a part of communication with our team. We like to celebrate individuals as well: Our monthly recognition program is chosen by our team and started in 2016. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s been around for about a year. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s exciting for both the winners and the people voting.WF: How did you get employees onboard with both the rebranding and shift in culture? Was it a challenge?Chen: People were pretty supportive. They had never had anything like this. Most of our employees are fairly new, and it was exciting for them to see these elements of transparency and recognition.It does take time to gain continued support. They want to make sure the change is lasting, so It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s important for us to do these things consistently and maintain the commitment from leadership. But over time, the culture is sustained by the team, so it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s important to have both leadership commitment and team support in place.Nothing like this is easy, but if leadership shows an authentic commitment, the team will come to support it as well.WF: Did the company\\xe2\\x80\\x99s new strategy require new skills in your workforce? If so, did you achieve this through hiring or by strengthening skills in existing employees?Chen: We like employees with a can-do, winning attitude. We want people who don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t give up when things get tough and instead find the best way to work around a problem. Our ultimate goal is to have a team with that type of positivity.I also truly believe in diversity in recruiting. The team we have now at H2O+ Beauty is diverse in their gender, ethnicity and professional backgrounds. Some have small business backgrounds and others come from large companies, and they\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve all worked in different industries. Having a team with those types of diverse backgrounds benefits the company, because they\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve seen and experienced a lot that they can bring to us.This is a sizable company, but we still want the elements of entrepreneurial spirit, which you can\\xe2\\x80\\x99t always find in large public companies. Of course, it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s as much a mental attitude as it is what they\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve experienced.WF: If you had to choose, what was the single most impactful change to your corporate culture that you made in 2016?Chen: I think the biggest change we\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve made is fostering transparency \\xe2\\x80\\x94 allowing people to tell us when they can\\xe2\\x80\\x99t do something and making sure they know that it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s OK. That\\xe2\\x80\\x99s a big change that existing employees have seen. We don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t always get things right the first time, so we need to be able to tell when we\\xe2\\x80\\x99re going the wrong way and fix it.For example, we are restaging some of our amenity products, and I remember a team member who came back and said that he didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t think we could meet a ship date our clients wanted. Once that was communicated, we said, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cHelp us figure out how we can make it work.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d The key is knowing what isn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t possible, working to see what is doable and planning how to make it happen. The solution becomes very collaborative.WF: That being said, is collaboration always productive, or are there times when it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s better for employees to act independently?Chen: There needs to be a balance between collaboration and independence. Not everyone loves to collaborate, and there are times people need to be able to work by themselves for efficiency. We can\\xe2\\x80\\x99t continue to work on everything on a consensus basis or else we don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t get anything done, and I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve seen that. There\\xe2\\x80\\x99s a balance: People need to know when they have enough feedback to move ahead, even if there\\xe2\\x80\\x99s not complete consensus.WF: What are your goals for the H2O+ Beauty workforce in 2017?Chen: For us, a lot of the hard work in rebranding is behind us, so now we\\xe2\\x80\\x99re focusing on growth from our new products and a strong marketing plan. We have the team we need in place already, but it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s going to be important to communicate our wins no matter how small or large.Nidhi Madhavan is a Workforce intern.

       " ['SubscribeBack IssuesContributeAdvertisebyChris SwanAs a new executive, trust your sense of fairness, know right from wrong, and care for others.After landing a new executive-level position, it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s time to think about the best strategy for getting the work done. Joining an organization is a critical time to assess and be assessed that all candidates should be actively concerned with.Here is some useful advice:1) Don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t get trapped by past patterns. Ask great questions. Listen carefully for subtlety and act based on what is being communicated.2) Push, but not too hard.3) Be humble and admit what you don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t know. Listen first and only decide after everyone has been heard.4) Use positive examples and remember that language communicates everything about who you are, why you are involved and where the company is going.5) Maintain a tight grip on your personal values. The board or the CEO hired you to lead, and you may not know all that you need to know about the operation; trust your sense of fairness, right from wrong, and caring for others.Each new career opportunity is a chance to build on your reputation with a new set of people. Take the time to eliminate what is unnecessary and focus on what is necessary. Ask the question, why is this done and why this way? One of my contacts shared that she simply stopped creating about half of the work product of her predecessor and no one noticed. She found time to make important changes to the organization and solidified her role as a TOP performer.What do I mean with \\xe2\\x80\\x9cTOP?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Human capital expert John O. Burdett defines it as a \\xe2\\x80\\x9cTested Outstanding Performer.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Consequently, all potential candidates should be considered for the arc of their career: where have they been, what impact have they had, are they leaving a legacy or were they simply an empty suit.TOP candidates understand career trajectory; one failure is not a tragedy but it is better to avoid the situation whenever possible. Making good, clear decisive decisions about your fit with an organization, personal candor and willingness to take risks. An individual is making a clear statement about their fitness to lead and make the right business decisions for their company.Without question, there are times when a TOP leader must put their position on the line. Issues of integrity and business ethics are far more important than a job, even a CEO job, and it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s in these instances when TOP leaders are tested. Senior candidates in transition have been able to tell this story with confidence.Leaders must think about their stories. Their stories should demonstrate their strengths and minimize or mitigate their perceived weaknesses. Stories must be interesting, honest and pointed. Telling your story makes you human and helps build connections.Hiring managers are looking for fit and the greatest performance. Everyone recognizes that the most promising leaders are typically in roles that offer the greatest opportunities for success, but that doesn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t mean that the most promising end up with the most success.Delivering success for employers and their customers also requires politeness, friendliness, courtesy and a positive or enthusiastic mindset. Finding all of these traits in significant amounts is rare. Finding leaders who can also focus on the goal, get others to deliver their best work and build a collaborative environment is the definition of TOP.So how does a leader avoid distractions, play nice with others, accomplish objectives and promote their success, while staying friendly, approachable and forever positive?

       " ['SubscribeBack IssuesContributeAdvertisebyJon HymanThis week, the White House announced a call to action to reform non-compete agreements [pdf]. Instead of proposing sweeping federal legislation, it is asking each state to pass non-compete reforms. This call to action comes on the heels of a joint White House/Treasury Department report [pdf] issued this past spring addressing the use, issues, and state responses to non-competition agreements.Why is the White House taking on this issue? According to its Fact Sheet, non-compete agreements narrow the employment options for an estimated one in five workers in the United States, which the White House believes has the real potential to slow job growth and increase unemployment.As a result, the White House is calling on state policymakers to pursue best-practice policy objectives, including one or more of the following objectives:I am encouraged by this White House initiative. First, consider that a White House that favors big government via federal agencies legislating instead of administering is not\\xc2\\xa0proposing federal non-compete reforms, but is\\xc2\\xa0instead calling on individual states to take on this issue on a state-by-state basis.Second, there is no doubt that employers overuse non-competes. Employers often misuse non-competes to try to scare every worker away from their competitors, knowing that the sheer cost of litigation serves to enforce an otherwise unenforceable agreement. Of course, costs flow both ways, and while a business may be better positioned to bear that burden, do you really need to spend money fighting a fight that, at the end of the day, you likely cannot win? Pragmatically, then, across-the-board non-competes for all employees do not make sense for employers.There is no reason to chain employees with overly broad agreements. Employers often use the destructive tornado of noncompete agreements to blow out a match-flame of competition. Instead, employers should target the specific issues of concern, such as trade secrets protections, non-solicitation, and non-disclosure of confidential information, and narrow the agreement only to address those concerns. The more narrow an agreement, the more likely it will be that an already skeptical judge (and judges typically do not like non-competes) will enforce it.In the right circumstances, non-compete agreements play a key role in protecting businesses and promoting innovation. Employers need to understand, however, that every employee will not destroy your business by leaving to work for a competitor. Your job in developing and deploying post-employment covenants is determining the specific interests you need to protect, and tailoring your agreement to that specific interest on an employee-by-employee, or job-class-by-job-class basis.Jon Hyman is a partner at Meyers, Roman, Friedberg & Lewis in Cleveland.

The study analyzed all C-suite positions, including chief human resources officer, across such industries as consumer, energy, financial, industrial, life science and technology.Of the six industries surveyed, life science had less than 1 percent of women with the CEO title while the consumer industry ranked the highest with 9 percent of women taking on top leadership. Overall, Korn Ferry found that CEO was held by only 5 percent of women.A significant finding in the report showed that when compared across all the top senior positions, 55 percent of chief human resources officer positions were held by women. The next highest position occupied by women was chief marketing officer at 29 percent, chief information officer at 19 percent and chief financial officer at 12 percent.Melissa Lamson is the CEO of Lamson Consulting.Melissa Lamson, CEO of Chicago-based Lamson Consulting, said from an organizational standpoint, gender parity is cultivated long before a women reaches the top.\\xe2\\x80\\x9cThe absolute most critical move an organization can make is to declare gender parity a core value, make sure it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s reinforced from the most powerful staff member down to the newest entry-level employee,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d she said.A distinct correlation between the competencies and duties of the CHRO and their similarities to a CEO was evident. According to the research, women ranked higher in competencies needed for CHRO, such as collaboration, negotiating skills, ability to balance multiple constituencies and an overall appreciation for the dynamics of business; all of which pertain to some aspects of the duties for a CEO. Still, women hit a barrier when pushing past this position.\\xe2\\x80\\x9cThe key lies in expanding our vision of what skills will help a woman succeed in the C-suite,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Lamson said.An organization that simply focuses on gender parity but neglects skill development will be left with employees who are unclear regarding what exactly propels them higher in the organization, she added.Peggy Hazard, managing principal for Korn Ferry said in a statement, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cStudy after study shows that diverse senior teams provide better corporate results.\\xe2\\x80\\x9dWhen breaking down the results by industry, the financial sector showed 28 percent of women take on higher C-suite positions followed by technology 25 percent, energy 24 percent, consumer and life science 23 percent and industrial 22 percent.Bryan Proctor, global financial officer practice leader at Korn Ferry said, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cA common barrier of female advancement to the top spot continues to be a lack of critical opportunities to demonstrate leadership, such as international assignments and operational roles.\\xe2\\x80\\x9dProctor added that there are a growing number of women who are proactively seeking high-level positions and experiences, and they are being rewarded and recognized for their efforts.Lamson said some women overlook networking as a critical step in career advancement.

From Microsoft\\xe2\\x80\\x99s acquisition of LinkedIn to the continuing build-out of functionality included in applicant tracking systems, the recruiting technology scene has never held more promise.Look at any mature recruiting technology platform and you\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll see things that would have scared recruiters 15 years ago.Ability to run deep searches for candidates across the internet and load them into your ATS? Check.Ability to track candidate activity via CRM functionality and create talent pools to develop relationships and speak directly to specialties that present the most difficulty recruiting? We have that, too!The list goes on related to what recruiting technology can provide. But there\\xe2\\x80\\x99s one pretty important thing the technology can\\xe2\\x80\\x99t do.Force your recruiters to use the technology.It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s true; for the technology to work, HR and talent acquisition leaders have to force their teams to use it. Which sucks, because it sets up incredibly talented HR/TA leaders for an uncomfortable confrontation that doesn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t feel like leadership.I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve been lucky enough to work with some great HR and talent acquisition leaders in the role of a consultant. One of the things I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve learned is that our industry has some incredibly talented people at all levels on recruiting teams like the one at your company.Recruiters work hard to fill jobs with great candidates. HR and talent acquisition leaders want to be the best. With that in mind, leaders like you start digging in and asking questions like, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cHow can we be the best recruiting shop in the industry?\\xe2\\x80\\x9dOne area that always comes up: \\xe2\\x80\\x9cDo we have the right recruiting technology?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d That question leads to deeper study. For most companies with a mature ATS, the answer is simple: Your technology is fine.But your recruiters don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t use it in their hour-by-hour workflow.\\xc2\\xa0 That\\xe2\\x80\\x99s called low user adoption, and it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s the reality for most leaders who are frustrated that they can\\xe2\\x80\\x99t take their recruiting practice to the next level with the help of the technology they\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve already purchased.Why is this important? Why can\\xe2\\x80\\x99t we just load the people we interviewed or hired into the ATS once we fill a job?More and more, the ATS has to be a system of record for your recruiting/TA function. To truly unlock the potential of recruiting analytics, talent pools and CRM, every action taken with a candidate has to be recorded in the ATS.Only by all activity being recorded in the ATS can the technology \\xe2\\x80\\x94 and the data/analysis it provides \\xe2\\x80\\x94 emerge as a strategic tool.Simply put, HR and talent acquisition leaders have to take the approach that if it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s not in the ATS, it didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t happen, and they have to measure their recruiters accordingly. That\\xe2\\x80\\x99s confrontation, and it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s hard to tell a top-performing recruiter they must document and use the system.But if you want your recruiting practice to unlock all the bells and whistles that salesperson sold you related to your ATS, confront you must.I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll wrap up this reality check on recruiting technology with the playbook for HR and talent acquisition leaders to get the ATS adoption they need from recruiters. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s a simple plan, but hard to accomplish.First, design the workflow, data entry and any implementation options you have related to your ATS to match your recruiting process. If you don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t have a documented process, you should get one.Many recruiting shops had poor project management from an IT partner and didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t customize the solution fully for their needs. Also remember that sometimes adjusting your process to match what the ATS can do is in your best interest as well.Next, make sure you\\xe2\\x80\\x99re maximizing how easy it is for recruiters to import profiles from sources like LinkedIn into the ATS. Never compromise on this, because it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s the primary thing that stops recruiters from using the system. If they can\\xe2\\x80\\x99t load easily, they won\\xe2\\x80\\x99t use it.Finally, audit regularly and create a scorecard that clearly shows who is using your ATS at a high level and consider changing incentive plans to make ATS use a priority.Assuming you have a strong team of recruiters, your recruiting technology isn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t the reason you can\\xe2\\x80\\x99t get your talent acquisition practice to the next level. Lack of use of the system by the people doing the work is your problem.You\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve got too many spreadsheets on the laptops of your recruiters. Kill the spreadsheets to get to the next level.\\xc2\\xa0Kris Dunn, the chief human resources officer at Kinetix, is a Workforce contributing editor.

Initially thinking, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI might as well wait until Monday,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Damiano ultimately called and was speaking to a doctor within 10 minutes. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cAs we went through the symptoms, the doctor encouraged me to go to the ER. I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m so glad I listened,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d she said. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI had several pulmonary embolisms that could have been fatal over the weekend.\\xe2\\x80\\x9dDamiano, the senior vice president of Denver-based Westerra Credit Union, is now a big proponent of telemedicine for the organization\\xe2\\x80\\x99s 260 employees. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cA number of things happen off hours and on the weekend,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d she said. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cIt is critical to provide our employees cost-effective options.\\xe2\\x80\\x9dWesterra is one of many U.S. companies offering telemedicine, which is the usage of technology to deliver medical care that would otherwise be delivered on-site or in person. Telemedicine \\xe2\\x80\\x94 a term that\\xe2\\x80\\x99s commonly used interchangeably with telehealth, although technically the words have slightly different meanings \\xe2\\x80\\x94 can include texting, video and phone calls.But despite employers\\xe2\\x80\\x99 newfound infatuation with it, employees don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t appear nearly as enamored. Only 3 percent of employees in the companies that offer telemedicine used those services in the first half of 2016, according to the National Business Group on Health\\xe2\\x80\\x99s \\xe2\\x80\\x9cLarge Employers\\xe2\\x80\\x99 Health Plan Design Survey.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Conversely, the same report found that 90 percent of the large employers offered the service in 2016.As more employers look toward telemedicine as a low-cost, convenient alternative to an in-person visit for routine types of medical care, they\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll need to address skeptics\\xe2\\x80\\x99 concerns. Many employees are not accepting the technology as an appropriate substitute for in-person doctors with the same enthusiasm as their employers.Meanwhile, some physicians remain neutral regarding telemedicine. Dr. Jack Resneck, professor and vice chair of dermatology at the University of California at San Francisco and an American Medical Association board member, said telemedicine is not something they are for or against.\\xe2\\x80\\x9cWe see it as an additional tool that actually has great potential,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Resneck said. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cThis is an area we\\xe2\\x80\\x99re excited about. We just want to see it done right so patients get good quality care.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\xc2\\xa0Employee Utilization and Communication\\xc2\\xa0Although the trend for employers is rapidly increasing adoption of telemedicine, employees aren\\xe2\\x80\\x99t necessarily buying in as quickly, said Dr. Aamir Rehman, partner and senior clinical and total health management strategy consultant at Mercer. Growth is steadily increasing, but it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s still low.A couple of factors may influence low utilization rates, Rehman said. In some cases, it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s simply informational. Employees might not know that their employer offers it.Other employees may know it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s an option for them but feel more comfortable seeing a provider face to face. Rehman added they could be uncomfortable using telemedicine and have qualms or questions such as, Is this person a real doctor? How can this doctor tell what\\xe2\\x80\\x99s wrong with me without being in the same room?\\xe2\\x80\\x9cThese are issues employees have brought up, and employers with a high utilization rate have succeeded in communicating and addressing these concerns,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Rehman.There are certain talking points for employers to focus on when communicating telemedicine, he added.\\xe2\\x80\\x9cIf you can get me to the right provider at the right time, then the outcomes will be better. If you have a problem at midnight or it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s noon and you\\xe2\\x80\\x99re at work and (telemedicine) can take that hassle out of accessing health care, then the outcomes will be better. That is the primary message,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he said.Clinical outcomes are often equal to that of a brick-and-mortar provider while costing less, said Rehman. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s less expensive to access care through telemedicine than an office visit. On average, a telemedicine consultation costs $40 compared to $125 for an office visit.About half of Westerra Credit Union\\xe2\\x80\\x99s workforce use telemedicine throughout the year, said Damiano. One important factor in getting that high usage was a robust communication strategy, especially during allergy season in the spring and flu season in the winter. This communication included giving instructions about using telemedicine and in which cases it should and should not be used.The Alvin Independent School District in Alvin, Texas, also successfully uses communication strategies to increase utilization. Donnie Marek, director of risk management, runs a self-funded medical plan for the district, which employs about 3,000 people across 30 campuses.\\xc2\\xa0 \\xe2\\x80\\x9cAny time you have a self-funded plan, you look for opportunities to slow down claims and provide better services for your employees,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he said.The district began offering telemedicine in September 2014 through Teladoc Inc. after Marek researched opportunities to reduce claims. It averages a 21 to 25 percent monthly utilization rate, which is good for an organization of its size, he said. Communication is key to its success rate, he added.\\xe2\\x80\\x9cOur district was a very reactive district for health insurance. When I was hired I flipped that to be very proactive. [Employees] are constantly getting information from my office,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he said.Marek sends out monthly emails to all employees, provides information to new hires and looks for employee testimonials with a positive experience with telemedicine. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cIf I get a good testimony from someone who has used it, I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll ask them to write up a quote, and I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll put it in the next blast that goes out. We\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve branded it well at our district,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Marek. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s also helped to have leadership buy-in from several school principals.To communicate the telemedicine benefit to employees who still do not use it, Marek has other plans for the fall 2017 semester. He, along with one other person, will visit each campus throughout the calendar year and attend faculty meetings at the current 30 campuses, along with two more opening up this fall.\\xe2\\x80\\x9cWe\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll talk about insurance and wellness, and telemedicine will be a huge part of the presentation. Getting in front of each employee in a smaller setting, they\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll listen,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he said. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI\\xe2\\x80\\x99m sure I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll be blown away by how many people don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t know about it, simply because people still don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t read emails. I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m excited about this.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\xc2\\xa0\\xc2\\xa0Making the Practical and Ethical ChoiceThere are hundreds of telemedicine providers with varied focuses, said Richard Foust, chief business officer of Chicago-based laboratory diagnostics company Analyte Health.When choosing a provider, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cIt\\xe2\\x80\\x99s important to ask questions about their approach to telehealth, because they\\xe2\\x80\\x99re all different,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he said. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cIf the HR manager is really thinking about what\\xe2\\x80\\x99s important, based on the size of the company and the employees they have, the decision will be different.\\xe2\\x80\\x9dEmployers should question the telemedicine company\\xe2\\x80\\x99s growth, Foust said. Adding lab testing will become increasingly critical to a telemedicine company\\xe2\\x80\\x99s development since physicians would then be able to make decisions not only based off what they see and hear from the patient, but also medical facts that come back from a test.Questioning quality is also important. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cIf I am going to be getting access to a physician at any point in time, how does that telehealth company ensure that I will get a good doctor?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Foust. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cAnd is that doctor part of a practice that readily reviews how they are treating patients, the outcomes they get and the feedback they receive?\\xe2\\x80\\x9dWhen an employer chooses a provider, it also has a responsibility to offer telemedicine ethically, said Resneck. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve seen some things that have worried me and been challenging around some quality and patient-safety issues.\\xe2\\x80\\x9dThe AMA released a set of guidelines for ethics in telemedicine in June 2016. It took three years for the AMA to develop the guidelines, which define a high standard of care to strive for in telemedicine.\\xe2\\x80\\x9cThe area that\\xe2\\x80\\x99s concerned me the most is care coordination,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Resneck. Care coordination \\xe2\\x80\\x94 defined as \\xe2\\x80\\x9cdeliberately organizing patient care activities and sharing information among all of the participants concerned with a patient\\xe2\\x80\\x99s care to achieve safer and more effective care\\xe2\\x80\\x9d by the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality\\xc2\\xa0 \\xe2\\x80\\x94 is an area where employers may fumble, said Resneck.\\xe2\\x80\\x9cIn the employer market, we have seen a lot of employers reaching out and looking at this as a benefit for employees, which is great, but the temptation I think has been to take the thing that\\xe2\\x80\\x99s the easiest to scale up quickly,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he said. Sometimes what\\xe2\\x80\\x99s been the easiest to scale up has been telemedicine providers that provide fragmented care.Resneck sometimes sees a patient using a telemedicine model where the provider of care doesn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t know who the patient is, doesn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t have their medical history and doesn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t share medical records after the virtual visit. Also, sometimes when a patient uses a telemedicine service to set up a consultation, the health plan may not cover a follow-up with the primary care physician they regularly see.Large and midsized employers shopping for health insurance or working with health plans are in a unique position to drive the conversation. They have an opportunity to say, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cIf we are going to work with a health plan to include telehealth as a benefit, let\\xe2\\x80\\x99s sit down and talk with the health plan and talk about ways to cover this coordinated care,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Resneck said.\\xe2\\x80\\x9cIf we saw employers pushing health plans to actually cover things like follow-up care with established physicians and care teams who know those patients, we could provide high-quality, coordinated care in a way that would be more efficient for patients,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he added.Employers should also push for proper identification of the physician, he added. Patients should know who their physician is and what their credentials are when they are seeking out care via telemedicine. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cWe definitely see telehealth providers where that is the case and others where that is not the case,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Resneck. Employers should encourage proper identification and transparency of credentials when they\\xe2\\x80\\x99re in talks with these health plans.That all being said, doctors and physicians embrace innovation, he added, and they see incredible potential for telemedicine to improve patients\\xe2\\x80\\x99 access to care.Westerra\\xe2\\x80\\x99s Damiano has seen this potential in her employees\\xe2\\x80\\x99 experiences. Many of them access the service off hours and avoid going to the ER for something that ends up being relatively minor, like an earache. Meanwhile, in her own experience, it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s meant something even more significant than one unnecessary ER visit. A pulmonary embolism, a sudden blockage of the major blood vessels in the lung, can be deadly.\\xe2\\x80\\x9cIf I hadn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t called the doctor, I wouldn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t have gone to the hospital,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Damiano. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cIt was a lifesaver for me.\\xe2\\x80\\x9dAndie Burjek is a\\xc2\\xa0Workforce\\xc2\\xa0associate editor.\\xc2\\xa0Comment below, or email at editors@workforce.com.

       " ['SubscribeBack IssuesContributeAdvertisebyRick Bell\\xc2\\xa0The overnight announcement of the pending acquisition of Monster Worldwide by Randstad Holdings was symbolic for this once-dominant player in the job-board industry.There was a time when Monster was the big-game hunter. But when the news that the Weston, Massachusetts-based job-board giant would be acquired by Randstad dropped into my inbox a tick past midnight Aug. 9 \\xe2\\x80\\x94 about 1 a.m. in Monster\\xe2\\x80\\x99s time zone \\xe2\\x80\\x94 it was apparent who finally became the prey.It was prime business time for Randstad, the Netherlands-based international staffing behemoth (although they fancy themselves as a \\xe2\\x80\\x9cleading HR services provider\\xe2\\x80\\x9d), which early this morning announced the $429 million acquisition of Monster. In fact, even the sale price reveals how far the mighty have fallen.The term \\xe2\\x80\\x9cjob board\\xe2\\x80\\x9d seems like a fond memory of the Wild West days in the online recruiting world, but consider that just a decade ago its stock hovered in the $50-plus range and Monster\\xe2\\x80\\x99s market capitalization was $7.5 billion. And with such colossal success, in 2007 Monster was the subject of acquisition rumors.But a stock option scandal, a flood of executive departures and an industry captivated by boutique job boards made Monster\\xe2\\x80\\x99s previous wins short-lived. Then-CEO Sal Iannuzzi attempted to quell the controversy and shortly thereafter Monster acquired key competitor Yahoo HotJobs in 2010. Still, the writing appeared on the wall. Its market cap had tumbled to $1.5 billion and again there were rumblings in 2012 that Monster had hung out the \\xe2\\x80\\x9cfor sale\\xe2\\x80\\x9d sign.Fact is, Monster didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t diversify its business the way rival CareerBuilder has (note its March acquisition of background-check company Auricio). And they flat just lost out to Facebook and LinkedIn in the new era of job postings.The joint release issued overnight states Monster will retain its brand and operate as a separate identity. And Monster CEO Tim Yates put a positive spin on the deal.\\xe2\\x80\\x9cJoining Randstad provides a unique opportunity to accelerate our ability to connect more people to more jobs,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Yates, who became CEO in 2014. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cTogether with Randstad, Monster will be better positioned to fulfill our core mission, and our employees will benefit from becoming part of a larger, more diversified company. Equally important, this transaction offers immediate value to our shareholders. We are excited to join and be supported by Randstad, as we continue to build the best recruiting media, technologies, and platforms. We look forward to working with the Randstad team to ensure a smooth transition.\\xe2\\x80\\x9dA story posted on Tech Crunch notes:\\xe2\\x80\\x9cWhile Monster\\xe2\\x80\\x99s bread and butter and mainstay is its website, Randstad has a focus on recruitment centers. It has some 4,500 branches and says it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s placed some 2 million people in jobs. This will give them an online component to expand that.\\xe2\\x80\\x9dAnd there is this from Susan Vitale, chief marketing officer at applicant tracking systems company iCIMS:\\xe2\\x80\\x9cThis deal underscores how complex talent acquisition has become and is one example of an organization trying to tie more pieces of the hiring landscape into one company,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Vitale said via email. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cHowever, we\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve seen that sourcing strategies remain diverse and one online or offline destination to reach a wide candidate pool is not enough. The ability to bring together multiple job advertising options along with various integrated tools for screening and assessing talent into one platform seems to be the preferred option of many of today\\xe2\\x80\\x99s large hiring organizations.\\xe2\\x80\\x9dMonster\\xe2\\x80\\x99s saga has been a wild one to follow.And if there was a prequel to the announcement, it was notable that Monster for the first time in memory did not have a monster-sized booth at this year\\xe2\\x80\\x99s annual Society for Human Resource Management conference, instead opting to sponsor a Tuesday night concert by second-tier band Train.Is this Monster\\xe2\\x80\\x99s final chapter? The Big 3 legacy job boards have dwindled to one, but it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s unlikely that we\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve heard the last of Monster.Rick Bell is Workforce\\xe2\\x80\\x99s editorial director.

       " ['SubscribeBack IssuesContributeAdvertise\\xc2\\xa0I recently spoke with a young techie. She\\xe2\\x80\\x99s created her own diversity app, and she wanted some media advice on how to publicize it as she preps for a formal launch. I happily shared what I know, but then the conversation stretched into some interesting areas.I asked if she always had an entrepreneurial spirit, something I want to cultivate in myself. She told me yes, though she tried to go the job route at first. But she was mistreated so many times, she figured, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI can do better by myself.\\xe2\\x80\\x9dShe has. She built a business and has been consulting and successfully sustaining herself for some time now. She gave me a good half-dozen links to valuable resources, and her energy and intelligence were intoxicating. I mean, this young woman was on the ball. She came to me for help, but I ended up inspired \\xe2\\x80\\x94 and disheartened.The things she was telling me \\xe2\\x80\\x94 horrors endured while trying to make it in the workplace \\xe2\\x80\\x94 gel perfectly not only with what I know personally, they could have been carbon copies of the articles I read so often about how unfriendly and ridiculous the culture in the tech industry can be for minority women.Nigerian born, with a name to match, this rising star told me about an interview where the white man at the helm spent more time asking questions about her name \\xe2\\x80\\x94 What kind of name is that? What does it mean? \\xe2\\x80\\x94 than he did asking about her skills or intended commitment to his team.I thought, OK, he was curious. He saw the interview as an opportunity to learn something new. But if that was his intention \\xe2\\x80\\x94 and we\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll say for the sake of argument that it was \\xe2\\x80\\x94 it was completely inappropriate and disrespectful. Based on what she told me, the guy broke like a half dozen interview/HR rules in short order.I asked her, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cWhat did you do?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t know what to do,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d she answered, and I could hear the sadness in her voice. It made my chest tight.\\xe2\\x80\\x9cWell,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d I said. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cIf that ever happens again, just know, you\\xe2\\x80\\x99re not getting that job; so shut that crap down immediately. Let that person know, I understand you may be curious, but the origins of my name are for another time. I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m here to discuss how my skills can benefit your organization.\\xe2\\x80\\x9dI said a few more things, but this is a PG blog, so we\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll keep it moving.She told me other stories, her friends\\xe2\\x80\\x99 stories. One Nigerian girlfriend was constantly being subjected to unwanted physical attention. People were touching her hair without asking for permission, and harassing her with question after question about it. When she finally spoke up for herself and asked that her supervisor stop it, the person snowed her under with work and stopped communicating with her.\\xe2\\x80\\x9cThat was punishment for having the audacity to protest someone\\xe2\\x80\\x99s wrong belief that your person is their playground,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d I said.My new friend sadly agreed.\\xe2\\x80\\x9cYour friend needs to find a new job. She\\xe2\\x80\\x99s ruined there,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d I said, and again, my young friend agreed. But it takes time to find a new position, and in the meantime her friend is bitterly unhappy and too scared and unsure to defend herself.My heart breaks for young women. Not because they deal with this kind of abuse on the job, per se, but because they don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t know how to deal with it. They don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t know how to respond. And that uncertainty means they stay in situations where they\\xe2\\x80\\x99re unhappy and their spirits, souls and skills are steadily depleted. There\\xe2\\x80\\x99s no way a supervisor like that is going to go the extra mile to develop, mentor or advance that young talent. That person is too busy smugly petting the office curiosity.See, I know how to back folks up off me. I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m so good at it, I can do it with a smile and without raising my voice or permanently damaging a relationship. And if I do damage that relationship, I won\\xe2\\x80\\x99t lose sleep or miss a beat because I know it wasn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t worth having anyway.But I had to learn how to do all that the hard way. I too had to endure all manner of indignities before I evolved into the media savvy blogger and professional woman that I am today. I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m thinking about writing a book, sharing the lessons that I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve learned. But today\\xe2\\x80\\x99s message is for organizations.Company leaders, you better be aware of who is interviewing prospective talent and how they\\xe2\\x80\\x99re representing your organization. Have the wrong people in this critical talent acquisition role and you not only lose great talent, you could open yourself up to legal punishment that will teach you a harsh lesson, quick.Tech giant Qualcomm just learned that lesson; at least, I hope they did. The company announced it will shell out $19.5 million to settle a gender discrimination lawsuit affecting some 3,300 women in STEM within its walls. According to Madelaine Miller Strauss from newspros.com, the organization will also undergo extensive internal program changes to shape a better workplace for women and create equal opportunities for them.Ouch. As my momma used to say, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cThat\\xe2\\x80\\x99s a lesson for your ass.\\xe2\\x80\\x9dBut it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s not just about the money. Introducing the right new product or service into the market could help a company recoup losses as severe as $19.5 million, and then set said company on a revenue-generating, industry-dominating course that will attract more bright new talent.I call it the cycle of success. Set up the organizational structure \\xe2\\x80\\x94 talent and performance management, hiring and retention practices, rewards and recognition, learning and development opportunities \\xe2\\x80\\x94 so that the players can collaborate easily and know that they are respected and valued, thereby releasing unnecessary tensions that might inhibit creativity and problem solving ability, and boom.That\\xe2\\x80\\x99s how you get, and stay, ahead of the competition. Face it. Very often that kind of fresh and fabulous idea generation and innovation, that kind of process efficiency or key competitive insight comes from young minds. Minds housed in bodies that look vastly different, that hold experiences, education and cultures as varied as the talent currently twisting uncomfortably in their seats during crappy interviews, and suffering on jobs where supervisors feel entitled to touch them inappropriately.There\\xe2\\x80\\x99s a pattern developing, and companies are losing, and losing big. Talented women and minorities are choosing entrepreneurship over traditional employment. They\\xe2\\x80\\x99re starting their own companies, they\\xe2\\x80\\x99re succeeding, and I applaud them.My tech-savvy Nigerian scholar is skilled, she\\xe2\\x80\\x99s determined, she\\xe2\\x80\\x99s educated \\xe2\\x80\\x94 she came from Stanford and is on her way to UC Berkeley \\xe2\\x80\\x94 and she cares. She built her diversity app because she wants to spare her peers the indignities that she\\xe2\\x80\\x99s suffered, to let them know which companies truthfully and sincerely care about diversity, and are welcoming to diverse talent and the well of nearly limitless potential they represent.So, if you\\xe2\\x80\\x99re a recruiter or a hiring manager you need to ask yourself what\\xe2\\x80\\x99s going on behind closed interview doors? Because good or bad, right or wrong, whatever it is could be the reason a fabulous new talent either joins your team or becomes an extremely motivated competitor.Kellye Whitney is the associate editorial director for Workforce magazine.

       " ['SubscribeBack IssuesContributeAdvertisebySamuel Greengard\\xc2\\xa0\\xc2\\xa0\\xc2\\xa0\\xc2\\xa0\\xc2\\xa0\\xc2\\xa0\\xc2\\xa0\\xc2\\xa0\\xc2\\xa0It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s no secret that marketing has pervaded almost every corner of society. In an era of branded stadiums and high-rise buildings, apps and highly targeted social media strategies, the ability to grab so-called \\xe2\\x80\\x9cmindshare\\xe2\\x80\\x9d and market share is everything.Of course, it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s tempting to think about human resources outside the tractor beam of today\\xe2\\x80\\x99s marketing frenzy. For decades, HR executives and recruiters quietly went about their job of matching candidates with positions, often through old-fashioned networking based on contacts and handshakes.But that was then. As social media has emerged as a force and sensibilities have changed \\xe2\\x80\\x94 particularly among millennials weaned on electronic devices and social sites \\xe2\\x80\\x94 the dynamics of hiring and recruiting are shifting. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cHR professionals must start thinking about themselves as marketers and embrace the tactics used in the B2B and B2C spaces,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Susan Vitale, chief marketing officer at applicant tracking firm iCIMS.Call it the rise of the consumer candidate. An iCIMS report, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cRecruitment Marketing: Fad or Future?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d found that 90 percent of HR professionals agree that having a strong employment brand is more important today than it was five years ago. What\\xe2\\x80\\x99s more, 84 percent agree that recruitment marketing is a worthwhile investment for companies. Yet, only 48 percent have made any plans to hire someone to oversee such a task.Today, an effective recruitment marketing strategy means moving beyond LinkedIn and job boards and viewing marketing in a more holistic and broad way by including videos offering chats and using platforms like Snapchat to connect with job seekers. It may encompass so-called \\xe2\\x80\\x9cnurturing\\xe2\\x80\\x9d techniques used by traditional marketers \\xe2\\x80\\x94 essentially keeping a prospect \\xe2\\x80\\x9cwarm\\xe2\\x80\\x9d through email and other communication until they are ready to make a move. This, in turn, requires more detailed tracking and analytics tools for social media, email click-through and open rates and more. Finally, there\\xe2\\x80\\x99s a growing need to build a strategy around reputation management and online reviews at sites like Glassdoor and Fairygodboss, a job site tailored specifically for women.\\xe2\\x80\\x9cAbout 80 percent of recruiting professionals have said that their techniques have changed or evolved over the last three years because of the influence of marketing,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Vitale said. Additionally, Ryan Healy, founder and president of Brazen Technologies, which offers a chat product used for recruiting, said: \\xe2\\x80\\x9cToday, it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s necessary to think about candidates as leads or prospects and make sure they engage with your brand in one way or another. Increasingly, job candidates do not come through listings and other traditional methods.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\xc2\\xa0Shaping the MessageIn reality, marketing has always played a role in hiring and recruiting. Brand image and the way an organization presents itself at job fairs, industry conferences and other events can influence how job seekers perceive a company \\xe2\\x80\\x94 and whether they choose to apply for a job. But today, the stakes have been ratcheted up exponentially. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cIt\\xe2\\x80\\x99s important to create a funnel along with content to attract and interest potential candidates,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Healy said.This may take the form of an e-book, e-brochures, videos, blog posts, wikis, social media content and other materials. In some cases, these materials could appeal to an audience by focusing on a topic of interest, such as lifestyle, sports or personal tech, rather than directly promoting the company. It may also incorporate videoconferencing and live chat functions that let a person ask questions, exchange thoughts and discuss opportunities in real time with a company representative. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cThe goal,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Healy said, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cis to create content and contact points at the top of the funnel to draw people in \\xe2\\x80\\x94 even if they aren\\xe2\\x80\\x99t ready to apply at that time.\\xe2\\x80\\x9dFacebook, LinkedIn, Google and other online tools are also key components.As individuals click on highly targeted ads and view the associated online materials, they may get a sense of what the company is about, what it offers and what types of candidates it hopes to find. For instance, a Facebook user may view an ad in their news feed based on previous click activity online. Clicking on the ad might send the individual to a YouTube or website video that features a hiring manager, engineer, business executive or field technician discussing their job or depicting a day in the life. In some cases, the video could be tied to the field in which the candidate has displayed interest, whether it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s engineering, sales, accounting or what have you.At the center of everything is an ability to track prospects and ensure that they are receiving what they need, when they need it. Just as conventional marketing attempts to monitor a prospect and keep the person engaged until the candidate is ready to pull the string on a purchase, HR marketing hopes to create a spark that may eventually lead to a fire. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s often not about a specific time period or hard sell; it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s about creating a framework that allows users to engage and learn at their own pace \\xe2\\x80\\x94 and stay in the pipeline.\\xe2\\x80\\x9cAt some point, sometimes months or years later, you may have the right position open and the person may decide it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s the right time to make a move,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Brian Kropp, HR practice leader for consulting and technology firm CEB.Not surprisingly, a growing number of organizations take the concept seriously. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cYou can\\xe2\\x80\\x99t just put an ad in the newspaper or an online job board and have people apply. There\\xe2\\x80\\x99s a need to connect with people in a more organic and meaningful way,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Shaunda Zilich, global employment brand leader for General Electric Co. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cAs a company, we have to realize we are not only selling products and services; we\\xe2\\x80\\x99re also selling opportunities for employment \\xe2\\x80\\x94 and people now choose companies based on their lifestyles and interests, including social issues and corporate responsibility. You have to catch them at the moment they\\xe2\\x80\\x99re receptive with the right message.\\xe2\\x80\\x9dGE uses everything from television ads designed to market the company broadly to targeted social media messages and advertisements, including on social media sites such as Snapchat and Facebook. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cWe see a lot of activity through the ads we place on Facebook. We\\xe2\\x80\\x99re meeting people who may not necessarily be looking for jobs, but sometimes they become interested,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Zilich said.Another company flexing its muscles in the recruitment marketing space is Gold\\xe2\\x80\\x99s Gym, which operates about 500 company-owned and franchised facilities worldwide. Wendy Moran, director of talent management, said that the fitness company also has focused on developing content that intersects with prospects and what interests them. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cYou really have to think of people as customers of the brand and develop content that is relevant for them.\\xe2\\x80\\x9dThat has translated into everything from e-newsletters to posts, ads and content at Facebook, Instagram and Snapchat. The firm also posts video clips at YouTube that focus on lifestyle issues such as nutrition and exercise. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cPeople who subscribe to our YouTube channel are passionate about fitness,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Moran said. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cThese people are actively engaged with the brand, and some of them will apply for a job. By connecting with them on a personal level, we increase the odds of making a good match.\\xe2\\x80\\x9dAt Lake County Schools in Florida, the competition for teachers has pushed the district of approximately 41,000 students and 45 schools to combine traditional recruiting with digital marketing. Like many districts, it recruits college graduates at job fairs. It recently used a \\xe2\\x80\\x9cStar Wars\\xe2\\x80\\x9d theme, for example, to attract attention and build brand awareness at an open house. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cWe are a relatively small district, and most people have never heard of us,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Instructional Recruitment Partner Quiana Peterson. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cIn many respects, we are at a disadvantage.\\xe2\\x80\\x9dThe district also places ads on Facebook and LinkedIn, and participates in the Troops to Teachers program that reaches out to veterans. When district recruiters spot someone who displays interest, they use Brazen\\xe2\\x80\\x99s chat function to engage in a one-on-one chat session through a conventional web browser or their smartphone. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cWe take a very personalized approach and try to build a nurturing kind of relationship,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d she said.\\xc2\\xa0Reputation MattersOnline sites such as Glassdoor have also altered the HR equation by serving up ratings and reviews. To be sure, job seekers have a much broader picture of a company than at any time in the past \\xe2\\x80\\x94 as well as exposure to online diatribes and rants. Just as reviews on Yelp or TripAdvisor may or may not deliver an accurate picture, comments posted online may encourage or dissuade a candidate. Studies show that consumers \\xe2\\x80\\x94 and job seekers \\xe2\\x80\\x94 increasingly depend on reviews to guide decision-making.\\xe2\\x80\\x9cIt\\xe2\\x80\\x99s critical to monitor ratings and reviews and understand what\\xe2\\x80\\x99s out there. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s now a foundational component of business,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Jeff Tomlin, co-founder and CMO for Vendasta Technologies, which offers a digital platform for small and medium-size businesses\\xe2\\x80\\x99 reputation management.Ratings\\xc2\\xa0 \\xe2\\x80\\x9care an important part of the business landscape. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s something that businesses cannot ignore,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d added Rick Ducey, managing director at marketing and media consulting firm BIA/Kelsey. He said that organizations must take a proactive stance by monitoring sites, addressing comments when possible, and acknowledging that they might also provide valuable feedback about how to improve.In the end, how can HR professionals and recruiters formulate a strategy that works? Building a hiring framework based on marketing principles requires an organization to rethink, rewire and reinvent an array of processes and systems. In many cases, conventional marketing tools from Salesforce.com Inc. and Oracle Corp. are too rigid or not designed for the needs of human resources. Meanwhile, applicant tracking systems may or may not have all the necessary features and hooks to social media and other tools. And a collection of best-of-breed software tools may pose challenges related to IT integration, managing data and tracking prospects.It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s also crucial for an organization to understand today\\xe2\\x80\\x99s digital environment and how pieces and data fit together to create a more relevant and customized experience for the end user. This includes using search engine optimization, Google Analytics and pay-per-click advertising data in a more sophisticated and integrated way. As Kropp puts it: \\xe2\\x80\\x9cToday, the best quality employees are often bombarded by recruiters using LinkedIn and other tools. It all becomes a lot of noise. However, if you are creating value and you have the processes and systems in place to deliver the right content and information at the right time, the fishing pond becomes a lot less crowded.\\xe2\\x80\\x9dMake no mistake, times have changed and HR professionals must change with them. GE\\xe2\\x80\\x99s Zilich said that today\\xe2\\x80\\x99s recruiters and hiring executives must be more open to experimentation and more aware of reputation management. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cMarketing has become a crucial part of hiring and recruiting,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d she said.Creating an ongoing dialog with the talent pool is mission critical, added Gold\\xe2\\x80\\x99s Gym\\xe2\\x80\\x99s Moran. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cIt\\xe2\\x80\\x99s not about the number of followers or subscribers. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s making sure you have the systems in place to keep in touch with prospects \\xe2\\x80\\x94 particularly those with the right knowledge and skills \\xe2\\x80\\x94 and deliver value to them. At some point in the future, they may want to work for you.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\xc2\\xa0In the PipelineBuilding a talent pipeline is nothing less than critical. Today, 75 percent of job seekers want to join a talent pool in order to stay more informed about company news and information, according to an iCIMS study from earlier this year. Moreover, 6 in 10 indicated that they would be interested in joining a talent pool for receiving updates from an organization where they would like to work. Meanwhile, a 2014 Glassdoor survey found that 76 percent of today\\xe2\\x80\\x99s job seekers want details about whether the firm is an attractive place to work.Not surprisingly, human resources organizations face a number of key challenges in pulling off the task and building a recruitment marketing program. According to iCIMS, half cited budget constraints, 29 percent said they lack the necessary technology, 28 percent lack an understanding of how to approach marketing, 26 percent cited company disinterest, and 18 percent said they cannot garner necessary support from the marketing department.Finally, 65 percent of HR professionals agreed that hiring a dedicated recruitment marketing specialist would make their company\\xe2\\x80\\x99s recruitment efforts more successful. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cIt\\xe2\\x80\\x99s not a question of whether to use marketing techniques, the issue is how to approach the task the best way,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Susan Vitale, chief marketing officer at iCIMS.Samuel Greengard is a writer based in Portland, Oregon.

       " ['SubscribeBack IssuesContributeAdvertisebySarah Fister GaleThe tight labor market may be a pain for companies struggling to hire hard-to-find talent, but it has been a boon for RPOs.For years recruitment process outsourcing was viewed as a transactional service to help companies quickly attract and screen lots of recruits to fill low-level positions. But when the recession ended, and talent became harder to find, companies started rethinking the role RPOs can play in the overall recruiting process. According to research firm Aberdeen Group, fully 41 percent of companies say they are using their RPOs to fill specific roles and job families that are closely tied to organizational performance and productivity, compared with just 11 percent in 2011.This shift in the talent marketplace is changing the way clients and RPO vendors work together, said Christine Nichlos, CEO of People Science Inc., an RPO provider. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cIn the beginning of the RPO industry, there wasn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t a lot of \\xe2\\x80\\x98talent\\xe2\\x80\\x99 in talent acquisition,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d she said. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cIt was more about taking work off their hands.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d But companies are getting more educated about the services RPOs provide and the benefits they derive from these vendors, including reductions in the time and cost of recruiting and increased retention. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cThat has led to more strategic relationships,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d she said.\\xc2\\xa0\\xc2\\xa0  Recruitment Process Outsourcing ProvidersSource: Companies \\xc2\\xa0\\xc2\\xa0Companies are also beginning to understand the value of the more proactive hiring services, including social, mobile and analytics tools that bolster their long-term recruiting goals. LinkedIn Corp.\\xe2\\x80\\x99s \\xe2\\x80\\x9cGlobal Recruiting Trends 2016\\xe2\\x80\\x9d report shows 59 percent of companies are investing more in their employer brand compared with last year. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cWith the job market so tight, many companies are looking for ways to get a leg up on identifying talent and creating a differentiated candidate experience,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Stacey Cadigan, director at Information Services Group, or ISG, a technology research, advisory and services firm in Stamford, Connecticut. In response, RPOs are expanding the services they offer to provide a more robust proactive recruiting deliverable.\\xe2\\x80\\x9cWe are seeing a lot more focus on front-end processes, like attracting candidates, sourcing and building pipelines,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Cadigan said. Her team has also seen increasing interest in proactive talent management services, like brand development and building talent communities to build a pipeline of talent for future openings. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cCompanies are looking to RPOs to help them align recruiting with the company brand in an effort to attract higher-quality candidates with the right culture fit,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d she said.That\\xe2\\x80\\x99s driving RPOs to roll out a host of new technologies and services to entice these clients, particularly around predictive analytics, branding and social recruiting tools. Such services are transforming the RPO model, but they are also giving companies a more holistic view of their recruiting needs and challenges, especially when it comes to branding, and helping companies understand what they can do to be more attractive to passive candidates.Many of the RPOs today, including Cielo, Futurestep, People Science and Randstad Sourceright have all made significant investments in analytics capabilities in recent years, along with social recruiting, branding and other technology tools to hasten the recruiting process. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cReporting and analytics is where we are seeing a lot of interest right now,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Bob Lopes, president, RPO Americas, at Randstad Sourceright, a global RPO, which has invested heavily in its data analytics solution in recent years. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cIt\\xe2\\x80\\x99s not just transactional data, it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s what the data tells us that they value.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d For example, if an open requisition to recruit is going to be difficult to fill, the analytics will tell them that on Day One rather than Day 90.\\xe2\\x80\\x9cAs our analytics capabilities mature, it is creating incredible transparency,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Angela Hills, executive vice president and managing director of the RPO Cielo. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cIt\\xe2\\x80\\x99s allowing us to deepen our partnerships and focus more strategically on the future.\\xe2\\x80\\x9dM&A Creates Global GiantsAll of these trends have driven steady growth in the RPO industry in recent years. In 2014, the industry grew 13 percent, pushing it over the $2 billion mark, and indicators suggest it will continue to expand at a projected rate of nearly 9\\xc2\\xa0percent through 2018.But that isn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t all good news for RPO leaders. The steady growth rate has also spurred increased competition, with new players entering the market while existing RPOs are merging with or acquiring companies to rapidly expand their global footprint in areas such as Asia, Europe and Latin America to meet their clients\\xe2\\x80\\x99 global hiring needs. Indeed, the largest growth in the industry is now coming from Europe, the Middle East and Africa, and Asia-Pacific countries, which grew at 21 percent and 31 percent, respectively, in 2014 compared with just 6 percent growth in North America, according to research from Everest Group. That led to several acquisition deals in the past few years, including Seven Step RPOs\\xe2\\x80\\x99 2014 acquisition of U.K.-based RPO BlueGlue; Wilson HCG\\xe2\\x80\\x99s 2015 acquisition of Head2Head, a Canadian recruitment services firm; and staffing solution provider, CDI Corp\\xe2\\x80\\x99s August 2015 announcement that it would acquire ScaleneWorks People Solutions, an RPO in India. And industry analysts expect 2016 to bring in a host of new global acquisition deals in this space.\\xc2\\xa0\\xc2\\xa0  Data BankSource: Aberdeen Group and Futurestep, a Korn Ferry Company \\xc2\\xa0\\xe2\\x80\\x9cHaving a global reach is very important for RPOs right now,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Lopes said. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cYou need centers of excellence in all of these regions to prove to clients that you have global expertise and that you can integrate their global needs into your business model.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Cielo\\xe2\\x80\\x99s Hills agreed. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cYou have to understand the local market, the culture and the legal environment to do well in these markets,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d she said. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cYou can\\xe2\\x80\\x99t achieve that through offshoring.\\xe2\\x80\\x9dThe industry has also seen acquisitions to expand its service offerings and technology capabilities, most notably Monster Worldwide\\xe2\\x80\\x99s 2014 acquisition of RPO TalentFusion, which brought together TalentFusion\\xe2\\x80\\x99s RPO expertise with Monster\\xe2\\x80\\x99s extensive infrastructure and social recruiting technology, to create a powerful position in the RPO space. Cadigan expects the acquisition trend to heat up in 2016, as RPOs rush to deliver a more robust portfolio of services. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cRPOs are struggling with the need to be constantly innovative,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d she said. These acquisitions will allow them to add new services to their lineups more quickly.Creating a rich service offering will be vital going forward, as these vendors are feeling pressure to differentiate themselves, particularly as 70 percent of total active RPO deals are expected to end in the next three years, according the Everest data. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cFierce competition is compelling market evolution: advanced pricing constructs and value-added services, including analytics, are coming into play, and service providers are expanding their capabilities across all types of hires to increase their market share,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d the report said.You Get What You Pay ForThere is still a gap between what customers want and what they will pay for. Even with all the new technology and strategic service offerings, the transition of the industry from recruiter to partner is far from complete, Cadigan said. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cClients are still looking for scale, speed and low-cost solutions from their RPO providers,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d she said. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cThat trend will continue for a while.\\xe2\\x80\\x9dThey also still rely on more traditional RPO metrics, such as time to hire, source of hire and the quality of the candidate pool, to judge the success of their RPO relationships even as they transition to more strategic forward-looking services. While these are all relevant statistics, they don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t factor in long-term planning and more qualitative measures such as brand perception. And while companies are drawn to the idea of talent communities, branding and predictive analytics, they still expect a transactional payment model. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cThey like the idea of investing in the future, but they want to pay per hire,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Hills said. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cIt is a disconnect that requires more education.\\xe2\\x80\\x9dThough these old perceptions are changing. Lopes noted that he has seen more clients purchasing end-to-end RPO services, in which the entire recruitment process is outsourced to the RPO than they have in the past, and he expects the trend to continue as these clients get more comfortable with RPO as a full recruiting service provider, and not just a stopgap measure. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cIt is part of the maturity curve,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he said. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cBuyers become more familiar with RPOs, and they like having the ability to scale recruiting up and down to meet their needs.\\xe2\\x80\\x9dWhen companies and RPOs can get past the transactional relationship to develop deep strategic partnerships, they can generate real business benefits, but it will only happen if RPOs can quantify that value. That means that, along with rolling out new services, they have to define clear measures of success, Cadigan said. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cThe better you can quantify business impact, the easier it will be for clients to prove the benefit of these relationships to the organization.\\xe2\\x80\\x9dPeople Science\\xe2\\x80\\x99s Nichlos agreed. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cTo affect change, we have to be able to tie recruiting to productivity,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d she said. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cAnd metrics are the only way to do it.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\xc2\\xa9 2017 Workforce Magazine.'],\n",
       " ['SubscribeBack IssuesContributeAdvertisebyJames TehraniWith all the weeding that goes on in the hiring process, I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m surprised more recruiters aren\\xe2\\x80\\x99t prize-winning gardeners. But sometimes companies might be letting great candidates get away in their need to weed.It starts with the cover letter, r\\xc3\\xa9sum\\xc3\\xa9 and, nowadays, dozens of answers from the company\\xe2\\x80\\x99s applicant tracking system.It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s not uncommon to hear things like, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cThis guy can\\xe2\\x80\\x99t even spell IBM and he wants to work here?\\xe2\\x80\\x9dSpelling and grammar mistakes are a common reason to reject candidates. I once thought I had an interview with a major magazine publisher, but it turned out to be more of an opportunity for the hiring manager to teach me a lesson by berating me for misspelling his last name on my cover letter. I knew I was done for when he showed me a collage on the wall of all the mailing labels he\\xe2\\x80\\x99d saved where someone misspelled his difficult-to-spell name.Lesson learned.\\xc2\\xa0For the few candidates who do make it in the door for an interview, there\\xe2\\x80\\x99s always weeding going on. Focusing on \\xe2\\x80\\x9cWhat did the candidate do wrong?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d and \\xe2\\x80\\x9cWhat red flags were raised?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d tend to trump examining all the good qualities a candidate possesses.And sometimes strong applicants do dumb things in interviews. I know I have.It was a few months after I graduated college. I had left a terrible internship where I spent most of my time faxing and photocopying and took a job as a waiter so I could have my days free to interview. Coincidentally, when you\\xe2\\x80\\x99re behind and overwhelmed in your serving duties, it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s known as \\xe2\\x80\\x9cbeing in the weeds.\\xe2\\x80\\x9dThere were many Friday and Saturday nights where I was in the weeds.As a waiter, you meet lots of different people from fiendish to friendly. There\\xe2\\x80\\x99s the guy, for instance, who scolded me for not putting his slice of pie down with the tip facing \\xe2\\x80\\x9ceither at 5 o\\xe2\\x80\\x99clock or 7 o\\xe2\\x80\\x99clock.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d But I also met nice people, too.One regular customer was a man in his 60s who worked in the publishing industry. We talked quite a bit, and I told him about my background and career aspirations. After a couple of months, he pulled me aside and told me he knew of a book publisher that was looking for an assistant editor. He told me to send the hiring manager my r\\xc3\\xa9sum\\xc3\\xa9 and that he had already put in a good word for me. Sure enough, I soon got the call to come in for an interview.I thought it was my big break. Surely his good word would be as good as gold in getting me the gig.It might have been if it weren\\xe2\\x80\\x99t for my dumb move.Before the interview, I had copied all of my best college clips and neatly arranged them in a nice-looking portfolio to show off my work. But then it dawned on me that this was an editing position, and not a writing job, so I needed to prove I could edit.Light bulb!At the beginning of my advanced editing class in college we were given a really hard test. I don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t recall many people doing very well on it, but I did particularly bad on it. OK, really bad on it. There must have been more red ink on it than a Peter Max \\xe2\\x80\\x9cBlushing Beauty\\xe2\\x80\\x9d poster. But as a way to prove to us how much we\\xe2\\x80\\x99d learned in the class, the professor gave us the exact same test as the final. I don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t think I aced it, but I did much, much better. I was proud of how much I\\xe2\\x80\\x99d learned about editing in that one semester.The problem was he never gave us our finals back, so all I had was the original test. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cAha,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d I thought. \"I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll bring the test to the interview to show the company how difficult it was and then explain how well I did on the final.\" \"It\\'s foolproof,\" I thought.More like proof I was a fool.While you\\xe2\\x80\\x99re never quite sure what someone thinks of you during an interview, I felt it was going really well. The conversation was free and easy, I don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t recall any stumbling blocks, so I was ready to close the deal. I pulled out my original test, and started to explain how hard the exam was and my vast improvement on the final.Of course, I didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t have the test to prove it.You can\\xe2\\x80\\x99t always pinpoint the moment when you blow an interview, but I blew it and I knew it, even if I didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t want to believe it. I tried to do damage control, but the interview ended shortly after.I don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t recall if I got a rejection letter, but the customer at the restaurant who got me the interview came in a week or so later with the bad news. He had talked to his contact at the company and she told him they were hiring someone else. As I rightfully suspected, the test had scared them away.I can\\xe2\\x80\\x99t say I blame them. It was a dumb thing for me to do. Hindsight, ya know. And maybe the person they did hire was a better fit anyway, but perhaps they missed out on a great candidate who made one boneheaded mistake.Weeding is essential in the hiring process, but sometimes companies do tend to focus too much on the few cons rather than the many positives. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s good to remember that there are some weeds you don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t have to pick because they\\xe2\\x80\\x99d actually look good in your garden.That\\'s my story; what\\'s yours?\\xc2\\xa9 2017 Workforce Magazine.'],\n",
       " [\"SubscribeBack IssuesContributeAdvertisebyMichelle RafterIf there truly is a shortage of workers in the STEM disciplines in the United States, it hasn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t hit Michael Higgins yet.Higgins, human resources director at Craig Technologies, said the Cape Canaveral, Florida-based aerospace and defense contractor has not lost out on a government contract because he couldn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t find enough of the qualified science, technology, engineering and mathematics workers who are the company\\xe2\\x80\\x99s lifeblood.That\\xe2\\x80\\x99s not the case for Ian Siegel, co-founder and CEO at ZipRecruiter Inc., a job site that takes submitted openings and aggregates them to 100 job boards. Competition is so intense for top Web developers that the Santa Monica, California-based company opened an office in Israel to hire enough software engineers able to do high-level systems architecture programming.\\xe2\\x80\\x9cIf you\\xe2\\x80\\x99re looking for a database engineer on job boards, good luck,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Siegel said. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cA database engineer in San Francisco is courted by recruiters every single day. That person will never look for a job again for the rest of their career, jobs will go to them. There\\xe2\\x80\\x99s too much interest.\\xe2\\x80\\x9dWhile U.S. companies, lobby groups and politicians debate the merits of the controversial H-1B visa program that allows employers to bring highly skilled immigrants here to help fill the supposed STEM jobs gap, businesses such as Craig Technologies and ZipRecruiter are coming up with their own workarounds. That includes poaching candidates from competitors, working with specialized recruiters, and doing school and community outreach to attract people to STEM professions.Executives such as Higgins maintain there are enough U.S. STEM workers \\xe2\\x80\\x94 at least in some fields if they can coax them away from their current jobs. Others are bumping up against honest-to-goodness deficits, especially in highly sought-after tech fields, that are causing skyrocketing pay and even auctions for the right for recruiters to fill positions. They predict the situation could get worse in 2016 given the nation\\xe2\\x80\\x99s unemployment rate is forecast to dip as low as 4.5\\xc2\\xa0percent.Some recruiters and industry insiders argue that the country\\xe2\\x80\\x99s STEM jobs problem is exacerbated by companies\\xe2\\x80\\x99 outdated attitudes toward talent acquisition. They maintain too many companies refuse to drop strategies adopted during the recession when labor supply outstripped demand by so much that employers could find candidates with the exact skills they needed and didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t have to offer training to get new hires up to speed.Though the recession is long since past, the economy and workforce are changing so fast that companies remain extra conservative about spending on training, said Rosemarie Christopher, president and CEO at MEIRxRS, a STEM staffing, recruiting and search group in Glendale, California, that fills regulatory, clinical research and medical affairs positions.\\xe2\\x80\\x9cThey say we don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t have time or money for apprentices,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Christopher, who has received federal government grants to help companies start apprenticeship programs. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cWe say, \\xe2\\x80\\x98If you want to have a STEM workforce at all, you need to build it somehow. You\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll see how easy it is once you do it one time.\\xe2\\x80\\x99 \\xe2\\x80\\x9dOrigins of the ProblemExecutives and recruiters fault the U.S. education system for failing to provide enough training to keep up with present and future demands for STEM jobs. That demand is projected to grow 13 percent from 2012 to 2022, to a total of 9 million jobs, according to a U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics report. Current median wages for STEM jobs are more than double those of all workers: $76,000 compared with $35,080, according to the report.Critics of the country\\xe2\\x80\\x99s current education system also fault employers for failing to consider a more diverse candidate pool when hiring for STEM jobs, and maintaining biases against hiring the long-term unemployed contribute to the problem.While the number of STEM positions is growing, the population of U.S. workers qualified to fill them isn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t. The National Math and Science Initiative, a tech industry funded nonprofit that supports STEM education efforts, estimates that by 2018, the country may be short 3 million high-skilled workers.As a result, STEM jobs take almost 50 percent longer to fill than non-STEM ones, according to ZipRecruiter statistics culled from the 700,000 job listings it posts a year, Siegel said. STEM positions get a fifth of the number of responses as jobs in other categories, and represent 3 out of 10 jobs that are hardest to fill, according to ZipRecruiter data.Scarcity has pushed up compensation, especially for tech jobs. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI\\xe2\\x80\\x99m a STEM business, and we do salary surveys to make sure we\\xe2\\x80\\x99re priced competitively, and every year the salary we pay engineers goes up because the competition is so intense,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Siegel said.In the absence of enough U.S. STEM workers, more companies are vying to hire foreign STEM workers through the federal government\\xe2\\x80\\x99s H-1B visa program, which grants them permission to work in the United States for up to six years. The U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services holds a lottery every April to fill the coveted 85,000 slots, including 60,000 for foreign workers and 25,000 for foreign students with advanced degrees from U.S. universities.As the competition for visas has increased, the chances of small or midsize companies getting an application approved have dropped. In 2014, the CIS received a record 233,000\\xc2\\xa0applications for the 85,000 available spots, a 35\\xc2\\xa0percent jump from the previous year.A large percentage of those come from large, well-financed U.S. and Indian outsourcing and tech companies that can afford to pay thousands of dollars for each application they submit. According to a New York Times analysis, in 2014, 20 companies took approximately 40 percent of all available H-1B visas. Of those, 13 were global outsourcers, including India-based Tata Consultancy Services, Infosys and Wipro; outsourcers based elsewhere, including Accenture and Cognizant Tech Solutions; and U.S. tech giants IBM, Amazon, Microsoft, Google and Intel.While tech companies and their lobbyists want to expand the H-1B visa program to allow more foreign STEM workers into the country, critics are bent on stopping employers from taking jobs away from U.S. workers and giving them to lower-paid foreigners. As proof of that trend, they point to companies such as Toys R Us and Southern California Edison that in the past year laid off veteran employees in information technology, accounting and other STEM jobs and replaced them with lower-paid H-1B workers, in some cases requiring the fired workers to train their replacements. In early 2015, Walt Disney Co. replaced veteran employees at Walt Disney World with H-1B workers from India. A few months later, however, Disney canceled a similar layoff \\xe2\\x80\\x94 without explanation \\xe2\\x80\\x94 that would have replaced tech employees at Disney/ABC Television in New York and Burbank, California, with H-1B workers hired through Cognizant, according to a Los Angeles Times report.In Congress, opponents of the current system advocate imposing stricter conditions on H-1B visas. Though they\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve been unsuccessful to date, critics such as Sens. Dick Durbin, D-Illinois, and Chuck Grassley, R-Iowa, continue to push bipartisan legislation. Their latest bill, introduced last November, would raise wage requirements for foreign workers entering the country on H-1B visas, increase monitoring and enforcement, and add protections for U.S. workers.Getting Around the ProblemWhile politicians and lobbying groups scuffle over the issue, companies that have been all but shut out of H-1B visas are left to figure out their own solutions to the STEM skills shortage.One short-term result has been hiring people with sought-after experience from competitors or other industries. Higgins admits that most of Craig Technologies\\xe2\\x80\\x99 new hires are passive candidates \\xe2\\x80\\x94 professionals skilled in areas such as building launch control systems for NASA\\xe2\\x80\\x99s manned space flight program or instructional system design for U.S. Army computer-based training.Because Craig Technologies mainly works with NASA and the U.S. Defense Department, it must meet federal regulations that protect sensitive information, and for that reason, can only hire U.S. citizens and green card holders. As a result, most candidates the company pursues are already working in the field, many for competitors.Higgins credits Craig Technologies\\xe2\\x80\\x99 two in-house recruiters for taking a long-term approach to filling openings, sometimes talking to potential candidates for 18\\xc2\\xa0months before a job opens that could be a good fit them. The company used that method to add about 144\\xc2\\xa0positions in 2015, with the vast majority of those representing new jobs, bringing its total workforce to more than 430.There\\xe2\\x80\\x99s only so much poaching and passive candidate prospecting a company can do. In five years since ZipRecruiter started, the company has grown to 70 engineers and a total of 300 employees, including some H-1B visa workers. To deal with skyrocketing salaries and competition for software engineers, the company opened a Tel Aviv, Israel, office in June 2014 to tap into that city\\xe2\\x80\\x99s tech worker pool.Today, the company\\xe2\\x80\\x99s Israeli office has four engineers and is scaling to 10, with most of them working on machine learning search techniques ZipRecruiter uses to help its employer customers do a better job of identifying potential candidates. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cThey do the Greek math, the really high-level architectural programming, not website development,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Siegel said.Beyond short-term measures, more employers are taking steps to help grow the pool of STEM employees. In spring 2015, Craig Technologies created a part-time STEM outreach coordinator position for a former full-time marketing communications employee who was already passionate about the subject. Outreach coordinator Carey Beam organizes factory tours and hands-on science workshops that introduce local middle school and high school students to STEM concepts that apply to what the company builds.NASA also invited the company to participate in a program called NASA HUNCH, short for high school students united with NASA to create hardware, in which public school students will use Craig Technologies\\xe2\\x80\\x99 facilities to construct simple parts that will be used in the International Space Station. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cNASA supplies the materials, [radio frequency identification] and quality check so they know they\\xe2\\x80\\x99re receiving product worthy of use, and, in turn, we provide the facility, equipment, mentorship and guidance,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Beam said. She expects NASA to clear the company to start working with students during the first quarter of 2016, which would make it one of the first private businesses involved in the program.In addition, companies of all sizes are teaming up with state, local and national nonprofit groups to promote STEM education and jobs. Craig Industries is part of the STEM Alliance of Central Florida, a regional group of companies that raise funds to run Lego Robotics and other STEM programs in local schools.Larger-scale projects include the Global STEM Alliance, which the New York Academy of Science and United Nations launched in 2014 to run programs to fund after-school science programs for middle-school students, match girls interested in STEM topics with female mentors with jobs in those fields. It also created an international discussion network for gifted, science-minded kids called The Junior Academy.Offering Training, Other HelpAnother stumbling block in getting STEM workers hired has been encouraging potential employers to see the value to starting or funding apprenticeships and training programs.Christopher, a 28-year search-industry veteran who runs MEIRxRS, secured funds through a $175 million U.S. Labor Department program announced in September 2015 to hire and train apprentices in various industries, one of several things she has done to help her clients fill STEM jobs. As of last November, Christopher had placed five quality assurance and regulatory compliance apprentices in small companies in the food industry that need to adopt measures required by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration\\xe2\\x80\\x99s Food Safety Modernization Act, which took effect in 2015. Under the apprentice program, a company can hire a trainee for about half the normal pay, and MEIRxRS uses federal funds to pay for training. The company got funding for the program through a division called Rx Research Services that is a subcontractor of a larger federal contractor as well as from state and local sources. As of late 2015, Christopher also had unfilled apprenticeships available in biostatistics, clinical trials and data management, and drug safety.Even with outside funding, Christopher said it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s hard to persuade companies to take a risk on hiring recent graduates or midcareer professionals who may have lost a job and need to be retrained on newer technology, regulations or standards.\\xe2\\x80\\x9cThey say we have no money to hire people to adhere to the Food Safety Modernization Act,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Christopher said. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cBut you have no right to sell to the general public if you\\xe2\\x80\\x99re making prepared food and people are getting sick and dying because it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s not done to certain quality standards. These smaller companies, one recall would wipe them out.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\xe2\\x80\\x9cThere\\xe2\\x80\\x99s always a way to find STEM workers, but you need to be willing to take the time and buy the training programs,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d she added.Small and midsize companies that can\\xe2\\x80\\x99t compete with deep-pocketed competitors to hire U.S. or H-1B workers with the skills they need also can provide training in the form of running or funding programs such as coding boot camps, said Steven Lindner, a partner with The WorkPlace Group in Florham Park, New Jersey. The recruitment process outsourcing company reviews 250,000 candidates and hires 5,000 people a year on behalf of EY, Wells Enterprises Inc. and other clients.Companies have to get over the mindset of wanting to talk to candidates with only \\xe2\\x80\\x9ccurrent, relevant work experience,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Lindner said. His RPO trains its recruiters not to jump to conclusions about employment gaps or get hung up on previous job titles. Recruiters are also coached to look at what a candidate can do rather than what they\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve done before. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cWe look for clues on their r\\xc3\\xa9sum\\xc3\\xa9 or in conversation,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he said. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cFor example, if they\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve enrolled in a certification or degree program, it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s a clue that it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s someone who\\xe2\\x80\\x99s advancing themselves, and we don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t want to be too quick to turn them down.\\xe2\\x80\\x9dEventually, computer science and other STEM knowledge will be woven into school curriculum at all levels, Siegel predicts. The job market has swung in a direction that favors STEM, he said. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cIt\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll lag a decade, but it will catch up because it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s so lucrative. I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m in my 40s, and when I was growing up, everyone wanted to be a doctor. Now, if you heard someone\\xe2\\x80\\x99s kid was working at Google you\\xe2\\x80\\x99d be excited for them. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s the new vanity job.\\xe2\\x80\\x9dAs work becomes increasingly more automated, employers will have a base expectation that employees in all roles have some STEM knowledge, he said. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cSTEM skills will be table stakes in the jobs of the future.\\xe2\\x80\\x9dClarification: An earlier version of this story misstated what ZipRecruiter Inc.'s business model is.

Industries that are especially dependent on STEM workers are among the\\xc2\\xa0fastest growing\\xc2\\xa0parts of the U.S. economy, so the demand for STEM workers will continue to grow over time.As the CEO of a fast-growing company with many STEM workers, I see firsthand the growing need for a greater supply of talent, and I feel the pain of struggling to fill job openings fast enough in high-demand categories.\\xc2\\xa0The difference in recruiting STEM workers and non-STEM workers at our company is palpable: managers who want to hire for lower-demand jobs submit to me detailed plans around the need for those workers, whereas I tell managers to hire every great software engineer they can find even if they do not know where they will put them to work.\\xc2\\xa0In addition, we recently hired our first engineering team in a foreign country, despite the regulatory and time-zone challenges involved, because we cannot hire equivalent teams fast enough in the U.S.In our globally competitive world, the U.S. must decide whether it wants to compete or retreat in STEM-driven industries. Retreating would have massive effects on the future dynamism and growth of the U.S. economy and jobs. While the issues that arise from rapid growth of tech industries in tech hubs can be complex and require deft policy responses, the only rational choice for the United States is to compete aggressively in STEM industries.Boosting STEM Workforce EffortsIn the short term, the U.S. can address problems in STEM industries by recruiting talented professionals worldwide. H1-B visas, for example, enable employers to identify qualified foreign nationals and grant them temporary status for specific jobs.While H1-B visas can apply to any number of industries, a significant portion was granted for STEM professionals for fiscal 2015. Currently, H1-B visas are capped at 85,000 annually, which is far too low a number to meet the present demand for STEM workers and allows only a fraction of those who are qualified and interested into the country.Ultimately, H1-B visas aren\\xe2\\x80\\x99t a long-term solution to a STEM worker shortage.\\xc2\\xa0The U.S. education system and job training infrastructure must generate a larger pool of qualified STEM workers from future generations entering the job market.\\xc2\\xa0Future entry-level workers must be comfortable using new technology and be able to quickly learn about new STEM disciplines.\\xc2\\xa0This does not mean parents should forbid their kids from majoring in English literature.\\xc2\\xa0The ability to think, learn and communicate comfortably on multiple subjects will be critical for future job requirements and will complement comfort with technical topics.\\xc2\\xa0Nonetheless, parents, educators and students must demand that the education system churn out graduates that are ready for STEM jobs.If the U.S. does not quickly improve our competitiveness globally in the most important job categories, those industries will move overseas faster than our next generation of STEM workers get educated and job ready.The time for action is now, but that action will have to be sustained for as long as we continue to believe that future generations should inherit an economy with good, high-paying jobs.Ian Siegel is co-founder and CEO of\\xc2\\xa0ZipRecruiter Inc.

To the delight of beer drinkers everywhere, today there are almost 3,500, according to the Brewers Association. Even for a \\xe2\\x80\\x9crecession-proof\\xe2\\x80\\x9d field like the beer brewing industry that even the Prohibition of the 1920s and early \\xe2\\x80\\x9930s couldn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t dry up, that\\xe2\\x80\\x99s a lot of competition.Near the top of that list in terms of sales volume \\xe2\\x80\\x94 third to be exact, according to the association \\xe2\\x80\\x94 is Sierra Nevada Brewing Co., which is famous for its Pale Ale. Based in Chico, California, Sierra Nevada was founded in 1979 by Ken Grossman, and it recently opened a second brewery in Mills River, North Carolina, to cut costs and lower its environmental footprint from shipping brews cross-country, Grossman told Inc. magazine in 2013. But unlike many companies that don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t like to help the competition \\xe2\\x80\\x94 McDonald\\xe2\\x80\\x99s rejecting Burger King\\xe2\\x80\\x99s McWhopper idea comes to mind \\xe2\\x80\\x94 Sierra Nevada and the industry in general looks to help its competitors whenever it can, said Deborah Gutman, Sierra Nevada\\xe2\\x80\\x99s human resources manager.\\xe2\\x80\\x9cWhatever Works\\xe2\\x80\\x9d recently spoke with Gutman about Sierra Nevada\\xe2\\x80\\x99s culture, talent management and recruiting. An edited transcript follows.Whatever Works: Can you tell me a little about the culture at Sierra Nevada and what you look for when you\\xe2\\x80\\x99re recruiting?Deborah Gutman: I think we have a really unique culture at Sierra Nevada, and definitely when we\\xe2\\x80\\x99re recruiting, we are looking for folks who line up with our core values \\xe2\\x80\\xa6 quality, integrity, sustainability and people.WW: I read an interview with Sierra Nevada founder Ken Grossman from a few years ago. I don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t know if this is still the case, but he said at the time that he was involved in interviewing all brewers. Does he still do that, and does that create any challenges?Gutman: I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m not sure recently he\\xe2\\x80\\x99s been involved with that, but certainly when we were getting into North Carolina and screening through those, he liked to at least have a conversation with those candidates. He definitely still is very much involved in the business. When we were getting North Carolina up and going, he was traveling back and forth every other week.WW: Tell me a little bit about the competitive nature of brewing. Currently there\\xe2\\x80\\x99s something like 3,000 craft breweries out there. So you\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve really got to set yourself apart to recruit talent I would think. What does Sierra Nevada do in that regard?Gutman: The wonderful thing is Ken has kind of created a legacy. We have a wonderful reputation in the craft brewing community. That in itself does some of our recruiting for us. And Ken has always been collaborative with other craft brewers and even startup breweries. We kind of not necessarily partner with them, but we\\xe2\\x80\\x99re happy to give our knowledge and know-how to other breweries in the industry. I feel like the craft brewing industry is very unique in that way. We\\xe2\\x80\\x99re really collaborative and friendly \\xe2\\x80\\x94 for the most part <laughs> \\xe2\\x80\\x94 because we want the craft brew industry to do well. We want to continue growing and get better. So I find that really unique about the industry. We have a great craft brew HR group [the Craft HR Group]. We email, we do phone calls once a quarter, and actually we had our first conference earlier this year [at the Craft Beer HR Summit in San Diego].WW: Do you actually share leads? If you find a good candidate you\\xe2\\x80\\x99re not planning to hire, would you ask if anyone else is interested?Gutman: We may not be that [laughs] open with our craft brew counterparts, but we are open with job descriptions. A lot of us participate in a craft brew salary survey that we do every other year. We have a third party administer it for us, so we keep it all confidential and things like that. So no one knows exactly what people are paying for each job, but it helps us keep a tap [laughs] \\xe2\\x80\\x94 no pun intended \\xe2\\x80\\x94 on what\\xe2\\x80\\x99s going on in the industry. But we are really collaborative about \\xe2\\x80\\x98What are you doing with maybe your beer perk?\\xe2\\x80\\x99 or if there\\xe2\\x80\\x99s other questions because some of these craft brewers are so small and just starting up, so we\\xe2\\x80\\x99re happy to help them out and share the things that we\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve done in the past.WW: Can you talk about retention? From what I understand, especially with brewers, there\\xe2\\x80\\x99s a lot of people who might want to go into the field, but it isn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t always the most lucrative career. So what does Sierra Nevada do to retain its employees?Gutman: Sierra Nevada has a wonderful package of benefits. \\xe2\\x80\\xa6 We have some great wellness perks. We have an annual walking challenge that definitely brings out the competitive spirit of the employees. And we have on-site yoga and massage. Of course, we have beer bucks. We also have a pub tab in our restaurant for folks. The longer they\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve been with us, the more their tab is at the restaurant that they can sign off on.WW: Do you have any partnerships with universities to tap into that pipeline for brewing talent?Gutman: We do a little bit. We are really good in a few of our departments about offering internships, so we definitely have worked with Oregon State University, who has a great brewing and fermentation science program, and also [the University of California at] Davis, which is very close to us. Their brewing program has been around for a while, and we are working in North Carolina with a couple of colleges over there.WW: Tell me about the beer camp for employees. What is that all about?Gutman: After employees have been here for a year, we randomly select several employees twice a year that get to do employee beer camp. So we work with their managers to make sure they can get that time off \\xe2\\x80\\x94 a couple of days\\xe2\\x80\\x94 to work with their co-workers, create a beer and then be able to enjoy it in our pub.WW: Have any of the beers gone to market?Gutman: Oh my gosh. That\\xe2\\x80\\x99s out of my realm. I don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t know. [Laughs]WW: In that article I read on Ken Grossman, at the time he was taking employees to lunch regularly, and he said, \\xe2\\x80\\x98I want our employees to think like owners, and I find that making a connection to as many people as I can helps with that mission.\\xe2\\x80\\x99 How does the company make employees feel that way?Gutman: That is something that I actually talk about in our new employee orientation every month. Ken and Sierra [Grossman, Ken\\xe2\\x80\\x99s daughter] and Brian, they want you to walk around this brewery and do your job as if you own the company. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s making sure that the things that we\\xe2\\x80\\x99re doing are sustainable, making sure we\\xe2\\x80\\x99re being as efficient as possible, that we\\xe2\\x80\\x99re not spending money where we don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t need to spend money. If there\\xe2\\x80\\x99s a safety concern, that you\\xe2\\x80\\x99re bringing it up so that we can correct it. And just having that awareness as if you own the business and take ownership in that. I think a lot of our employees take that seriously. We want to hear folks\\xe2\\x80\\x99 ideas. We\\xe2\\x80\\x99re growing so rapidly, and especially as the new employees come in and I go through this with them: \\xe2\\x80\\x98You have a fresh set of eyes. You\\xe2\\x80\\x99re coming from different experiences, so if you have a question or an idea, we want to hear it.\\xe2\\x80\\x99 We\\xe2\\x80\\x99re getting bigger now. We\\xe2\\x80\\x99re over 1,000 employees, but the nice thing is we still have that small-company feel where if we have a new idea or a new process that we want to put in place, we can pretty much turn it around quickly and start doing it.\\xc2\\xa9 2017 Workforce Magazine.'],\n",

Unfortunately, if employees and dependents don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t receive early detection and care, it is logical that claims, in the long run, will escalate and productivity will decline.While Ralph Colao said: I started to see this years ago with the first implementation of [consumer-driven health plans]. When people have to spend their own money, they begin to scrutinize the need for care based on their individual perceptions of need and severity and cost/benefit. Based on the client reports I have seen, the greatest percentage seeking and completing preventive services has been 34 percent, and that was a group with a majority of women. I applaud the introduction of consumerism into our health plan designs. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s important and necessary, as are incentives to drive consumer behavior and accountability for health among patients. However, this new concept has caught most patients/consumers unprepared on how to behave in this new world. It will take education, tools and information, patience and, yes, some pain. But employers need to understand that to fully reap all the benefits and total value of a shift to consumerism and proactive engagement in health, they must establish a work climate that supports total health, from the physical, emotional, financial, environmental and social perspectives.

But barely any of its workers took advantage of the free money \\xe2\\x80\\x94 including the 65 percent of its Latino workforce.\\xe2\\x80\\x9cThe participation is alarmingly low,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d among minority workers, said Stacy Betz, Mariani\\xe2\\x80\\x99s human resources director. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cThere is something about that commitment that seems bothersome.\\xe2\\x80\\x9dLess than half of Mariani\\xe2\\x80\\x99s Latino workforce participates in the plan, and most who do use it as a savings account when the company suspends employment during the winter when summer lawn maintenance season is over, Betz said.Improving retirement outcomes for minorities has been a back burner issue for years. The emerging number of unprepared minorities and the projected growth of Latino and African-American populations over time may wind up becoming a crisis if nothing is done, warns Keith Green, president of the American Retirement Initiative, an industry group aimed at improving retirement outcomes for all workers.\\xe2\\x80\\x9cIt is one of the biggest domestic public policy issues of our time,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Green said. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cThere is a lot to do in a short periodof time. What are we going to do 20 years from now when these people can\\xe2\\x80\\x99t retire?\\xe2\\x80\\x9dMariani, based in Lake Bluff, Illinois, and ranked as the nation\\xe2\\x80\\x99s 33rd-largest landscaping firm by Landscape Managementmagazine, allows workers one loan to take out half of what is in their account and need to pay it back before becoming eligible for a loan again.Mariani also does its part in helping workers understand benefits. Betz is available to answer questions, and the company holds bilingual informational sessions on benefits twice a year. It also has a financial adviser come in monthly to aid all employees with money-making decisions, but with the exception of the mandatory informational sessions, few minority workers take advantage of the additional help.\\xe2\\x80\\x9cWe give them calculators and show them what their paycheck would look like if 2 percent or 3 percent were deducted, for example,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Betz said. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cIt does make us extremely concerned because it is evident that they still don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t understand the intent of the plan. I don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t know what the barrier is because we have done significant education.\\xe2\\x80\\x9dFalling BehindOverall, study after study has shown that many Americans are not saving enough for retirement, and that most minority groups are well behind that average. Earlier this year, The Urban Institute analyzed 2013 U.S. household data gathered by the Federal Reserve and found that Latinos and African-Americans are in worse shape in terms of saving for retirement, largely because they have less wealth than their white counterparts.Signe-Mary McKernan, author of the analysis and senior fellow at The Urban Institute said wealth was important because it represented family assets like savings and real estate, and it has served as a backstop for emergencies as well as a door to moving up the economic ladder. The analysis showed wealth inequality among different groups in the United States has only grown larger over the past 50 years. In 1963, the average white family had $117,000 (converted to 2013 dollars) more wealth than nonwhite families. By 2013, that number has climbed to $500,000.\\xe2\\x80\\x9cIf you are worried about rent and paying the next electric bill, retirement isn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t something you can worry about,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Green said.When there is little wealth, there is even less room to save for retirement, McKernan said. White families hadseven to 11 times more in average liquid retirement savings than African-American or Latino families.\\xe2\\x80\\x9cIt\\xe2\\x80\\x99s all interrelated,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d McKernan said. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cThe majority of people of color are not on a firm wealth-building path, and the fact that it hasn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t improved is a problem we have to pay attention to.\\xe2\\x80\\x9dIn addition to the wealth gap, access to retirement plans at the workplace has been a major contributor to low savings rates among Latinos and African-Americans. About 62\\xc2\\xa0percent of white workers have a retirement plan on the job compared with 54 percent of African-American workers, and 38 percent of Latino workers, according to 2013 study by the National Institute on Retirement Security.The savings numbers are lacking, too. Three-quarters of African-American families and 80 percent of Hispanic families have less than $10,000 in retirement savings compared with half of white families. What\\xe2\\x80\\x99s more alarming is that nearly two-thirds of minority households have no savings in an individual retirement account or 401(k), NIRS data show.The retirement issues facing minorities in America aren\\xe2\\x80\\x99t new, and while they haven\\xe2\\x80\\x99t gone unnoticed, there\\xe2\\x80\\x99s an entire generation catching much of the attention, Green said.\\xe2\\x80\\x9cThe interest is millennials, not African-Americans or people of color,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Green said. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cPart of the challenge is that this isn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t the target market for most big providers. People barely saving are not a core market.\\xe2\\x80\\x9dIn the Year 2060 \\xe2\\x80\\xa6But there\\xe2\\x80\\x99s a sleeper issue: non-Hispanic whites, the current majority group in America, is expected to dip to 44\\xc2\\xa0percent of the population by 2060 when the country is expected to have no single group in the majority spot. Overall, population growth is expected to slow by 2060, but the Latino population is likely to increase 116 percent, doubling to 119 million from 55 million in 2014, U.S. Census Bureau figures show. African-Americans should increase in numbers as well, rising to 60 million in 2060 from 42 million in 2014.A growing populace that is historically not saving for retirement can hamstring the workforce overall, said Joe Ready, executive vice president and director of Wells Fargo Institutional Retirement and Trust.\\xe2\\x80\\x9cThe average age of the workforce is creeping up, and people are putting off retiring in general,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Ready said. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cWhen people are financially strained, they are not as engaged in the workplace.\\xe2\\x80\\x9dActing on solutions that can help minorities become better savers can adjust the health of all retirement accounts, said Catherine Singley Harvey, program manager for the economic and employment policy project at the National Council of La Raza.\\xe2\\x80\\x9cTargeting solutions that impact retirement savings among Latinos can turn the tide on the national retirement crisis,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Harvey said.For workers with access to plans, features like automatic enrollment into professionally managed accounts such as target-date funds and automatic annual increases in employee contributions can greatly change outcomes, experts agree.The Vanguard Group Inc. studied seven large defined contribution plans and found that 92 percent of Latinos participated when automatically enrolled compared with 68 percent who enrolled on their own. For African-Americans, 90 percent started accounts with auto features compared with 59 percent who signed up. In total, there was a 20 percentage point difference among all employees who were automatically enrolled (93 percent) vs. regular registration (73 percent).Auto features are efficient not only from a participation standpoint, but also from an investment strategy as well, said Cynthia Pagliaro, a senior research analyst at Vanguard. The company\\xe2\\x80\\x99s data show that 89 percent of Latinos and 88 percent of African-American participants who were automatically enrolled were put into a professionally managed target-date fund.That means the investment choices and risk levels were no longer a guessing game; they were appropriate for the worker\\xe2\\x80\\x99s age and self-adjusted over time. For workers who sign up on their own, only 23\\xc2\\xa0percent of Latinos and 21 percent of African-Americans chose target-date funds.\\xc2\\xa0\\xe2\\x80\\x9cWe call auto features the great equalizers,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Pagliaro said. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cThese are powerful tools to mitigate differences in outcomes.\\xe2\\x80\\x9dSome states are also toying with automatically putting workers into plans if none is available at the workplace. California, Connecticut, Illinois and Oregon are working on strategies that would automatically put workers (at small businesses with no company-run retirement option) into state-run plans or other types of individual retirement accounts. Typical ideas include auto savings at 3 percent of pay.More than 6 million private-sector employees in California don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t have access to a company retirement plan, and 64 percent of those are minority workers, state records show.\\xe2\\x80\\x9cIf California can get this right, it will create a significant model for the country,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Harvey said.Meanwhile, technology advances are helping plan sponsors look more closely at workforces to identify savings gaps in retirement plans.\\xe2\\x80\\x9cIf you have ethnicity data, it can be really valuable in terms of how to implement plans,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Wells Fargo\\xe2\\x80\\x99s Ready. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cWe are continuing to add pieces to the puzzle, so we can learn how to better communicate and help people make better decisions.\\xe2\\x80\\x9dDefined contribution record-keepers like Wells Fargo can look at the 401(k) information companies provide such as gender, age, ethnicity, participation and contribution rates to pinpoint problem areas.Wells Fargo works with companies to identify what they call plan champions, people who can serve as the go-to person for workers who may not be comfortable going to the human resources director or other traditional outlets for help.In a 2014 survey of 528 Latino investors, Wells Fargo found that 72 percent want to know more about investing and that 35 percent of respondents ages 25 to 39 said they were more comfortable working with a Latino financial professional.\\xe2\\x80\\x9cHispanics are very willing to take advice from atrusted friend or relative,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Ready said. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cWe started the plan champion idea to help engage peers. We are just beginning to do this and see a real opportunity.\\xe2\\x80\\x9dMassMutual Financial Group has used its technology to help companies with large Latino workforces develop effective communication campaigns in English and Spanish. The company has a Spanish-language website and uses multimedia approaches in both languages for clients, including Web-based education, direct mail and one-on-one sessions.\\xe2\\x80\\x9cRetirement shouldn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t be a mystery,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Chris Mendoza, director of Latino markets for MassMutual. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cPeople shy away from it because there is a lack of information in their language, and they don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t know where to start.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\xc2\\xa9 2017 Workforce Magazine.'],\n",

       " [\"SubscribeBack IssuesContributeAdvertisebyAmy WhytePhoto courtesy of Thinkstock.Employers have more tools to assess potential hires than ever before \\xe2\\x80\\x94 but they\\xe2\\x80\\x99re taking their own sweet time making their hiring decisions.New software tools can mine data from job applications and personality tests to find the candidates who best match open positions. Video conferencing makes it possible to interview potential hires multiple times without the cost of bringing them into the office. And increased adoption of social media has changed the way people look for jobs and how employers hire.\\xe2\\x80\\x9cComing out of the worst recession since the Great Depression, and with the wide adoption of new technologies both for business and personal use, the hiring industry is experiencing a major transformation and will keep evolving at a rapid pace,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Susan Vitale, chief marketing officer of e-recruiting provider iCIMS Inc.Now, in addition to the traditional application and interview process, companies can screen potential employees with a variety of methods including assessments and tests, Vitale said. But with each additional method of evaluating a potential hire, the time it takes to actually hire an employee increases.\\xe2\\x80\\x9cThere is an array of screening tools companies use that are valuable but may drag the process out further,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Vitale said.New research from Glassdoor shows that employers all over the world are taking longer to hire new workers. On average, the hiring process has increased by 3.3 to 3.7 days since 2009.Andrew Chamberlain, chief economist at Glassdoor and author of the study, attributes the longer process primarily to the types of screening methods used by employers. He said each additional evaluation method can add up to eight days to the overall process. According to Chamberlain\\xe2\\x80\\x99s research, job skills and personality tests can add about a full day each, while group interviews add about six days. Phone interviews add the most time, increasing the hiring process by 6.8 to 8.2 days.While Chamberlain said more careful screening of candidates could lead to better hires, it could also result in candidate burnout.\\xe2\\x80\\x9cEmployers could be losing out on top talent because their interview process is longer than other companies\\xe2\\x80\\x99,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Chamberlain said.Time Trials and TribulationsLogan Franey, co-founder of e-commerce store Man Cave Authority, said the hiring process for his first job out of college took nearly four months.\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI was so frustrated,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he said.Though he did end up getting the job and liked the company just fine once he started working there, Franey said he was unhappy with how long it had taken to get from his first interview to his start date.\\xe2\\x80\\x9cIt was really just waiting around,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Franey said.In addition to keeping potential hires waiting around, a lengthy hiring process can take up significant internal resources and time, Chamberlain said.\\xe2\\x80\\x9cThis can eat into your employees\\xe2\\x80\\x99 time, causing decreased productivity overall,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he said.However, Chamberlain said the interview process might be longer today because spending more time vetting candidates is simply more necessary in today\\xe2\\x80\\x99s job market.\\xe2\\x80\\x9cHiring more specialized and technical workers requires more careful screening of applicants,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Chamberlain said. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cIn recent years, a growing number of studies in economics show a marked shift away from low-skilled, routine jobs and toward higher-skilled, less-routine positions like software engineers or government workers, requiring judgment and technical skills.\\xe2\\x80\\x9dAt AT&T Inc. for example, Lisa Mitchell-Kastner, the telecommunications company's vice president of talent acquisition, said the typical hiring process begins with an online application, followed by an online skills assessment and at least one interview. The number and type of interviews, and therefore the amount of additional time spent evaluating a particular candidate, vary depending on the position. Some job seekers might receive an offer after a single phone interview \\xe2\\x80\\x94 others can face multiple rounds of interviews, first with a manager and then a team.\\xe2\\x80\\x9cBoth hiring managers and candidates are making a big decision,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Mitchell-Kastner said. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cTaking the right amount of time for the candidate to understand the cultural components, job expectations and other factors that make candidates successful are just a few items that can be hugely beneficial to both parties.\\xe2\\x80\\x9dTime to Re-evaluateChamberlain recommends that in order to ensure the best possible hiring process, and minimize waste, employers should re-evaluate how they hire employees on a yearly basis.\\xe2\\x80\\x9cEach company is different and has different needs when it comes to the hiring process,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Chamberlain said. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cIf companies know exactly what is needed to hire candidates for their company, there\\xe2\\x80\\x99s a good chance they will find everything they are doing may not be needed, though conversely, they may find new things they need to institute to really pinpoint and find the best-fit candidates. This varies for each company, but it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s companies who can streamline their interview process that will have the advantage.\\xe2\\x80\\x9dChamberlain added that the focus should not be making the process shorter, but more efficient.\\xe2\\x80\\x9cAn extended interview process can be beneficial to both job seekers and employers as it allows prospective hires to gain a deeper understanding of the company\\xe2\\x80\\x99s culture through firsthand experience with current employees, the work environment and the overall employment brand,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Vitale said. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cIt\\xe2\\x80\\x99s most important to realize, however, that an organization can position itself as a sought-after employer of choice and hire the best candidates just as effectively and more quickly with the right technology, automated processes and recruitment marketing strategies in place.\\xe2\\x80\\x9dBy finding a hiring process that is both efficient and effective, employers can make the best possible job matches \\xe2\\x80\\x94 which will in turn boost retention and job satisfaction among employees.\\xe2\\x80\\x9cAlignment to performance, company culture and ensuring candidates have the right skills to be successful in the job tend to lead to lower attrition and higher job satisfaction,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Mitchell-Kastner said.\\xc2\\xa0Amy Whyte is a Workforce editorial intern.\\xc2\\xa0Comment below or email\\xc2\\xa0editors@workforce.com.

       " ['SubscribeBack IssuesContributeAdvertisebyJames TehraniHey, Elio, you seem to have done one hell-io of a good job.Outside of lottery winners, not many people are paid $1.8 million for not even doing a day\\xe2\\x80\\x99s work.It was announced on June 23 that Elio Leoni Sceti, the formerly soon-to-be CEO of beauty products company Coty Inc., will be paid close to a $2 million severance package. In terms of the C-suite that amount\\xe2\\x80\\x99s not newsworthy. The unusual part is that Sceti wasn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t even supposed to start working for the company until July 1.In other words, he quit before he started and still got paid for it. Correction: Paid well for it.Few people can truthfully post that status update without adding \\xe2\\x80\\x9cLOL.\\xe2\\x80\\x9dSo that\\xe2\\x80\\x99s $1.8 million for zero hours of work. Do the math; no, seriously, please do the math. As a literary-minded person, I can\\xe2\\x80\\x99t quite figure out this theoretical pay-rate equation.\\xc2\\xa0\\xc2\\xa0\\xc2\\xa0The company also said it would buy back about $55,000 in preferred stock that Sceti had purchased, according to the Associated Press. The company\\xe2\\x80\\x99s interim CEO, Bart Brecht, will remain in that role until a new new CEO is brought in. You have to hand it to Sceti for negotiating such a favorable contract.In a news release, Coty said: \\xe2\\x80\\x9cWe certainly understand Elio\\xe2\\x80\\x99s decision not to join Coty as planned, thank him for his professionalism throughout this process and we wish him all the best in his future endeavors.\\xe2\\x80\\x9dThank him, not kick him? How polite.Granted, we don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t know the specifics about why Sceti backed out of the job \\xe2\\x80\\x94 if not the golden parachute.There could be a legitimate reason we\\xe2\\x80\\x99re not privy to: health, family, etc. That said, if I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m the person who recruited Sceti, the former CEO of frozen-food company Iglo Group, I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m shaking in my boots and doing my best to avoid the icy glares coming from the board and C-suite.This nonstarter tale speaks volumes to the importance of recruiting, especially for the C-suite. We all know that the economic costs of a bad hire are huge \\xe2\\x80\\x94 perhaps not $1.8 million for most positions but still considerable. In a CareerBuilder survey from 2013, 27 percent of U.S. employers said a single bad hire cost the company more than $50,000.What\\xe2\\x80\\x99s not as well-documented are the \\xe2\\x80\\x9cother\\xe2\\x80\\x9d factors of making a poor hiring decision.According to a 2014 Robert Half International survey, 39 percent of HR professionals and hiring managers said a poor hire cost them productivity, and 35 percent said a poor hire affects team morale. Among chief financial officers 95 percent said a bad hire at least \\xe2\\x80\\x9csomewhat\\xe2\\x80\\x9d affects team morale.No matter the situation, a change at the top can be nerve-wracking for employees, and if I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m a Coty marketing coordinator making about $53,000 per year \\xe2\\x80\\x94 which, by the way, was roughly the median income of all U.S. households in 2013 \\xe2\\x80\\x94 I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m not a happy camper to know that my former future CEO just made $1.8 million not to join the company.While the Sceti situation might be an anomaly in the business world, it is still a great example of why good recruiting is so important.But come to think of it, when Coty made the Sceti hiring announcement on April 20, the company\\xe2\\x80\\x99s stock was trading at about $25 a share on the New York Stock Exchange; today the stock is trading at about $31. Again, go ahead and check my math, but that\\xe2\\x80\\x99s about a 24 percent increase.So maybe it wasn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t such a bad hire after all; perhaps Coty should throw in a gold Apple Watch, too, for a job well done.\\xc2\\xa9 2017 Workforce Magazine.'],\n",

It should include plans for effective employee branding, improving the candidate experience, and being sure you are using the right technology to engage and attract passive candidates. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cThe actual recruiting process comes after all of that.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Indeed, many companies are now actively reviewing and improving their approach to talent acquisition in an effort to get ahead of the rising demand for talent. Deloitte\\xe2\\x80\\x99s 2015 Global Human Capital Trends survey shows that 66 percent of global leaders say they are currently updating their retention and engagement strategies, or have done so in the past 18 months. However less than half of respondents consider their program capabilities to be good or excellent, which suggests there is still a lot of room for improvement.Are You Ready?For many companies, improvements to the talent acquisition process are focused around harnessing technology and social media to attract and retain the best people and to make sure they have both the skills and personality to fit the position. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cCulture fit is just as important as skills,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Erickson said.But companies should also pay attention to the skills and needs of their recruiting team. Deloitte research shows that development programs for recruiting staff are the top predictor of talent acquisitions performance, Erickson said. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cThe companies that invest in recruiter training programs get the right candidates faster than companies that skimp on training.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d<!--{cke_protected}{C}%3C!%2D%2D%0A%20%2F*%20Font%20Definitions%20*%2F%0A%40font-face%0A%09%7Bfont-family%3A%22%EF%BC%AD%EF%BC%B3%20%E6%98%8E%E6%9C%9D%22%3B%0A%09mso-font-charset%3A78%3B%0A%09mso-generic-font-family%3Aauto%3B%0A%09mso-font-pitch%3Avariable%3B%0A%09mso-font-signature%3A1%20134676480%2016%200%20131072%200%3B%7D%0A%40font-face%0A%09%7Bfont-family%3A%22Cambria%20Math%22%3B%0A%09panose-1%3A2%204%205%203%205%204%206%203%202%204%3B%0A%09mso-font-charset%3A0%3B%0A%09mso-generic-font-family%3Aauto%3B%0A%09mso-font-pitch%3Avariable%3B%0A%09mso-font-signature%3A3%200%200%200%201%200%3B%7D%0A%40font-face%0A%09%7Bfont-family%3ACambria%3B%0A%09panose-1%3A2%204%205%203%205%204%206%203%202%204%3B%0A%09mso-font-charset%3A0%3B%0A%09mso-generic-font-family%3Aauto%3B%0A%09mso-font-pitch%3Avariable%3B%0A%09mso-font-signature%3A-536870145%201073743103%200%200%20415%200%3B%7D%0A%40font-face%0A%09%7Bfont-family%3ATradeGothic%3B%0A%09mso-font-charset%3A0%3B%0A%09mso-generic-font-family%3Aauto%3B%0A%09mso-font-pitch%3Avariable%3B%0A%09mso-font-signature%3A3%200%200%200%201%200%3B%7D%0A%20%2F*%20Style%20Definitions%20*%2F%0Ap.MsoNormal%2C%20li.MsoNormal%2C%20div.MsoNormal%0A%09%7Bmso-style-unhide%3Ano%3B%0A%09mso-style-qformat%3Ayes%3B%0A%09mso-style-parent%3A%22%22%3B%0A%09margin%3A0in%3B%0A%09margin-bottom%3A.0001pt%3B%0A%09mso-pagination%3Awidow-orphan%3B%0A%09font-size%3A12.0pt%3B%0A%09font-family%3ACambria%3B%0A%09mso-ascii-font-family%3ACambria%3B%0A%09mso-ascii-theme-font%3Aminor-latin%3B%0A%09mso-fareast-font-family%3A%22%EF%BC%AD%EF%BC%B3%20%E6%98%8E%E6%9C%9D%22%3B%0A%09mso-fareast-theme-font%3Aminor-fareast%3B%0A%09mso-hansi-font-family%3ACambria%3B%0A%09mso-hansi-theme-font%3Aminor-latin%3B%0A%09mso-bidi-font-family%3A%22Times%20New%20Roman%22%3B%0A%09mso-bidi-theme-font%3Aminor-bidi%3B%7D%0Ap.Roadmap-PinCalloutbody%2C%20li.Roadmap-PinCalloutbody%2C%20div.Roadmap-PinCalloutbody%0A%09%7Bmso-style-name%3A%22Roadmap%20-%20%5C%5BPin%20Callout%5C%5D%20body%22%3B%0A%09mso-style-priority%3A99%3B%0A%09mso-style-unhide%3Ano%3B%0A%09margin%3A0in%3B%0A%09margin-bottom%3A.0001pt%3B%0A%09line-height%3A11.5pt%3B%0A%09mso-pagination%3Anone%3B%0A%09mso-hyphenate%3Anone%3B%0A%09mso-layout-grid-align%3Anone%3B%0A%09text-autospace%3Anone%3B%0A%09font-size%3A9.0pt%3B%0A%09font-family%3ATradeGothic%3B%0A%09mso-fareast-font-family%3A%22%EF%BC%AD%EF%BC%B3%20%E6%98%8E%E6%9C%9D%22%3B%0A%09mso-fareast-theme-font%3Aminor-fareast%3B%0A%09mso-bidi-font-family%3ATradeGothic%3B%0A%09color%3A%23026699%3B%0A%09letter-spacing%3A-.15pt%3B%7D%0A.MsoChpDefault%0A%09%7Bmso-style-type%3Aexport-only%3B%0A%09mso-default-props%3Ayes%3B%0A%09font-family%3ACambria%3B%0A%09mso-ascii-font-family%3ACambria%3B%0A%09mso-ascii-theme-font%3Aminor-latin%3B%0A%09mso-fareast-font-family%3A%22%EF%BC%AD%EF%BC%B3%20%E6%98%8E%E6%9C%9D%22%3B%0A%09mso-fareast-theme-font%3Aminor-fareast%3B%0A%09mso-hansi-font-family%3ACambria%3B%0A%09mso-hansi-theme-font%3Aminor-latin%3B%0A%09mso-bidi-font-family%3A%22Times%20New%20Roman%22%3B%0A%09mso-bidi-theme-font%3Aminor-bidi%3B%7D%0A%40page%20WordSection1%0A%09%7Bsize%3A8.5in%2011.0in%3B%0A%09margin%3A1.0in%201.25in%201.0in%201.25in%3B%0A%09mso-header-margin%3A.5in%3B%0A%09mso-footer-margin%3A.5in%3B%0A%09mso-paper-source%3A0%3B%7D%0Adiv.WordSection1%0A%09%7Bpage%3AWordSection1%3B%7D%0A%2D%2D%3E-->Recruiters also need to work closely with hiring managers \\xe2\\x80\\x94 ahead of the hiring process \\xe2\\x80\\x94 to develop a recruiting strategy that includes clear expectations for the manager\\xe2\\x80\\x99s role in assessing and interviewing candidates, and making decisions promptly. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cBuilding collaborative relationships with hiring managers is another top predictor of talent acquisitions performance,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Erickson said, noting that these relationships are four times more influential than other recruiting effort in delivering successful hires.PlanCreate a brand: Your employment brand sends a message to potential recruits about what it will be like to work for your company, so think about what you want them to know, said Madeline Laurano, research director of human capital media acquisition for Aberdeen Group. Your brand might tell them you offer a fast-paced environment with room for growth, a fun place to work where they will love their job and make friends, or a startup environment where they can have a

what you need: You can\\xe2\\x80\\x99t hire good people unless you know what you are looking for. Ideally a company will proactively develop profiles for every critical role in the company. These profiles can be assembled through interviews with managers and employees. A review of the characteristics of high performers can also be used as a benchmark for \\xe2\\x80\\x9cwhat good looks like.\\xe2\\x80\\x9dDefine your value proposition. Recruiting isn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t just about the salary, Tower Watson\\xe2\\x80\\x99s Grundy said. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cTo win great talent you have to be able to provide them with a robust employment proposition, great culture and career opportunities.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d In-house or outsource: Before you can start recruiting, you need to decide who will do your recruiting. Some companies outsource, others build an in-house team, and many use a combination of both. There are pros and cons to each model, Laurano said. The benefit of staying in-house is that those recruiters tend to understand the culture better, they have stronger relationships with hiring managers, and they are focused on finding great people for your company \\xe2\\x80\\x94 without worrying about the needs of other clients.But if hiring isn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t your strong suit, or you don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t have the resources, network or ongoing need to have a full-time recruiting staff, outsourcing is an easy way to secure good candidates with little effort.Choose your tools: Recruiting technologies, including applicant tracking systems, automated screening, video interviewing and analytics tools add efficiencies to every stage of the process.Define your process: Creating a consistent hiring experience across the organization ensures that managers and recruiters know what is expected of them and recruits have a positive experience.\\xc2\\xa0A good recruiting plan requires:DoParticipate in workforce planning: An effective recruiting strategy begins with workforce planning to make sure your talent acquisition plan supports the strategic goals of the business, Gundy said. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cRecruiting isn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t just a strategy to source candidates, it is the way companies build lasting productivity to achieve business goals.\\xe2\\x80\\x9dStart with a rough idea of how many people you expect to hire for the year, and then:Create a timeline: Using your workforce planning data, make a rough plan for the year, keeping in mind that every role requires a slightly different hiring strategy and schedule. Remember this is just a rough plan, and not something that can be succinctly broken into 12 identical chunks, said Jonathan Brown, vice president of global solutions at Futurestep, a Korn Ferry company. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cSome months recruiters will have nothing to do and others they will be swamped.\\xe2\\x80\\x9dGet your name out there: Build talent communities around all the candidates you come in contact with, and connect with them through periodic emails, articles and updates about openings, Erickson said. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cThe most effective talent communities stay engaged with candidates on a regular basis.\\xe2\\x80\\x9dStart looking: When positions open, talk to the hiring manager about their expectations, to create a timeline and profile for the new hire, then set your expectations for how quickly they will interview candidates and make decisions.Build a short list: Use automated screening tools, background checks, application reviews and initial interviews to narrow your candidate list, then schedule interviews.Make an offer \\xe2\\x80\\x94 promptly: If you force candidates to wait for weeks for an answer, they will likely find a position somewhere else.Follow up: After the hiring process is completed, interview managers and new hires to get a sense of the recruiting experience and what could be improved.ReviewTrack your metrics: Reviewing time to hire, cost to hire, turnover among hires and where candidates come from will let you know what\\xe2\\x80\\x99s working and what isn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t, Towers Watson\\xe2\\x80\\x99s Gundy said. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cNot a lot of companies are doing this step successfully.\\xe2\\x80\\x9dReport back: \\xe2\\x80\\x9cCreate checkpoints in your talent acquisition cycle to review how you are doing compared to your targets, and report that to senior leadership,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Brown said.

       " ['SubscribeBack IssuesContributeAdvertisebySarah Fister GaleCompanies may have big plans to grow their workforce this year, but there is an ongoing war for top talent, and companies need better tools and strategies to secure the best recruits \\xe2\\x80\\x94 especially younger candidates with high expectations for the recruiting experience.According to CareerBuilder, one-third of employers have plans to add full-time staff this year, which is a 50 percent increase over 2014; and Glassdoor Inc.\\xe2\\x80\\x99s 2015 Recruiting Outlook Survey shows talent shortage is the No. 1 hiring challenge today.\\xe2\\x80\\x9cRecruiting as a business strategy is going to get relevant much quicker than people expect,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Holger Mueller, principal analyst and vice president at Constellation Research Inc. If companies don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t adapt their recruiting process, they aren\\xe2\\x80\\x99t going to be able to fill these roles, especially as seasoned baby boomers head toward retirement. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cIf you can\\xe2\\x80\\x99t find the right people, you can\\xe2\\x80\\x99t grow your business,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he said.Fortunately, recruiting technology vendors are here to help. This segment of the human resources tech sector is full of innovative young companies eager to help customers add speed and efficiency to every aspect of the recruiting process, from marketing jobs via social media and building talent communities to simplifying and streamlining the application, interviewing and onboarding processes.\\xc2\\xa0\\xc2\\xa0\\xc2\\xa0\\xc2\\xa0\\xe2\\x80\\x9cAll of the HR tech trends around big data, mobile, social and cloud, started with recruiting,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Derek Beebe, director of HR technology for HR consultancy Towers Watson & Co.And the biggest innovations are coming from the smallest vendors. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cThe pace of change in this sector is outpacing the big providers\\xe2\\x80\\x99 ability to keep up,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Beebe said. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cThe smaller, nimble organizations are the ones on the leading edge.\\xe2\\x80\\x9dJoin the CommunityOne of the most popular areas for innovation in this space is around social media. Beebe points to tools like iCIMS Inc.\\xe2\\x80\\x99s Social Distribution, which helps companies leverage social media sites through employee referral networks and automated job publishing. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cICIMS has nailed the social component of recruiting,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he said.It appears that iCIMS isn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t alone. Bullhorn Inc., Jobvite Inc. and Newton Software Inc., and other applicant tracking systems vendors are fleshing out their own social media engagement tools to provide customers with more holistic ways to connect with passive candidates online.They are also beginning to build features that allow customers to create \\xe2\\x80\\x9ctalent communities,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d where recruiters can track and stay engaged with candidates who might one day be a good fit for the company, even if they aren\\xe2\\x80\\x99t looking today. This is part of the larger trend of companies curating their own social networks of candidates, said Ivan Casanova, senior vice president of marketing for Jibe, a cloud-based recruiting software company. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cTalent networks will differentiate how well organizations market themselves and build their brand within the talent pool.\\xe2\\x80\\x9dIt may also give them a new way to entice passive candidates, who appear to be growing weary of cold calls from recruiters and networking sites \\xe2\\x80\\x94 Glassdoor\\xe2\\x80\\x99s survey shows more than half of hiring decision-makers say their passive recruiting efforts have grown less effective in attracting highly qualified candidates, and nearly half say that candidates respond to emails and phone calls at a much lower rate than they did in the past. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cThe old methods of recruitment and job search just aren\\xe2\\x80\\x99t working well enough,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Steve Roop, general manager of Glassdoor for Employers, in a news release. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cPotential candidates are researching opportunities through new, interactive channels, and hiring decision-makers are planning to invest more in these channels to attract more qualified candidates.\\xe2\\x80\\x9dGoing Mobile (But Not There Yet)This shift in how companies use technology to connect with candidates reflects a broader effort to make the application experience less frustrating, said Kathy Kalstrup, an executive vice president at Aon Hewitt.For years vendors have focused on how they can make the recruiter\\xe2\\x80\\x99s job easier and more efficient. But as the demand for talent quickly outweighs supply for many critical roles, vendors have shifted their thinking, Kalstrup said. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cToday it is all about making the candidate experience as easy and seamless as possible.\\xe2\\x80\\x9dA big part of this transition is occurring through the adoption of mobile recruiting apps and mobile-optimized career pages. The bigger HR tech players, including SuccessFactors, Taleo Corp. and Workday Inc. all offer mobile tools to support recruiters on the go, and Workday even took a \\xe2\\x80\\x9cmobile first\\xe2\\x80\\x9d approach to building its recruiting software.\\xc2\\xa0\\xc2\\xa0\\xc2\\xa0\\xc2\\xa0\\xc2\\xa0Smaller vendors are equally mobile-focused as they strive both to meet the needs of recruiters and to accommodate candidates where they spend most of their time. According to LinkedIn Corp.\\xe2\\x80\\x99s Global Recruiting Trends survey, 28 percent of companies report that candidates applied for positions using mobile devices in 2014 (up from 16 percent in 2013); and 34\\xc2\\xa0percent say their career site was mobile-optimized in 2014. This is also up from just 20 percent the previous year, but still suggests that a large majority of companies are still struggling to adapt to the mobile trend. These companies are looking to industry vendors to help them close this gap.For example, Sonoco Products Co., the global product packaging company headquartered in Hartsville, South Carolina, is working with a handful of independent recruiting tech vendors to address shortcomings in its recruiting technology. The company, which has 22,000 employees worldwide, relies on Tweetmyjobs to generate traffic and market new opportunities via social media; iMomentous to build out its mobile job application process and to collect data on its talent pipeline; and Async Interview to conduct video interviews of candidates as a way to streamline its screening process. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cIt\\xe2\\x80\\x99s a piecemeal approach, but we\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve seen solid results,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Keesha Moore, Sonoco\\xe2\\x80\\x99s talent acquisition specialist. The tools are helping her reach a broader candidate pool and shorten the hiring process, and it gives her a chance to test new recruiting technologies for a relatively low investment.\\xe2\\x80\\x9cOur next step is to find a vendor who can help us with predictive analytics for workforce planning,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d she said.Recruiting Analytics: Just Getting StartedShe\\xe2\\x80\\x99s not alone. Workforce analytics continues to be the holy grail for companies that are trying to figure out where the best candidates come from, how much time and money it takes to find them, and how successful their recruiting processes have been. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cCompanies aren\\xe2\\x80\\x99t just interested in how many people they hire; they want to understand the quality of their hires,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Amy Wilson, vice president of human capital management product strategy at Workday.Fully 64 percent of global talent leaders say they are not doing a great job tracking return on investment on sources of hire, according to LinkedIn\\xe2\\x80\\x99s global recruiting survey. Though again, the vendors are doing everything they can to make that happen.All of the recruiting technology firms, from the startups to the enterprise giants, are trying to build better, easier and more robust analytics tools to help customers improve and measure their recruiting efforts. But it is still a work in progress, said Jibe\\xe2\\x80\\x99s Casanova. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cUsing analytics to enable data-driven recruiting is a big trend, but we are only at the very beginning.\\xe2\\x80\\x9dMost vendors offer some version of an analytics dashboard and/or metrics to track where candidates come from and basic measures around quantity of candidates and time to hire, though they are far from delivering on the promise of predictive analytics. Casanova predicts that the real benefit won\\xe2\\x80\\x99t be seen until these tools become a seamless part of the recruiting workflow \\xe2\\x80\\x94 like the dashboard in a car. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cUntil the technology is integrated into the recruiter\\xe2\\x80\\x99s life, there won\\xe2\\x80\\x99t be mass adoption,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he said.While that vision may be years away, there are some interesting innovations already in the market. Mueller points to Work4 Labs, a social media recruiting vendor that uses analytics to post job openings to social media sites where the most attractive candidates for the job spend most of their time. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cIt\\xe2\\x80\\x99s a more intelligent way to search,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he said.Similarly, HireVue Inc.\\xe2\\x80\\x99s new Insights tool provides companies with analytics to analyze their internal hiring processes, including how good interviewers are at making the best hiring decisions. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cThis is something no one else is doing,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Beebe said.Forget the R\\xc3\\xa9sum\\xc3\\xa9Vendors are also coming up with more innovative ways for recruiters to assess a candidate\\xe2\\x80\\x99s fit, for both the position and the culture, said Forrester Research analyst Claire Schooley. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cWe are moving beyond the r\\xc3\\xa9sum\\xc3\\xa9,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d she said.For example, video interviewing tools from vendors like Async and HireVue allow managers to see applicants in action before scheduling face-to-face meetings; HackerRank lets companies assess the skills of tech professionals by giving them programming challenges to solve; and vendors like BrandAmper and Match-Click help companies market themselves and their corporate environment to candidates who are looking for a place where they will find a good culture fit. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cIt\\xe2\\x80\\x99s an interesting time in the recruiting space,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Schooley said. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cEveryone is focused on building relationships and making sure a candidate is a good fit for the company.\\xe2\\x80\\x9dPrepare for Another M&A FrenzyDespite all the exciting innovations that are coming from small stand-alone vendors, the big HRMS players still have a powerful value proposition to offer because their recruiting tools tie into the broader talent management systems. Workday\\xe2\\x80\\x99s Wilson noted that one of the biggest things its client advisory board is interested in is the ability to recruit internally. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cRecruiters want access to both internal and external candidates, and they want to be able to compare them side by side,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d she said. That\\xe2\\x80\\x99s more likely to be accomplished if you are using a single HR management system because it holds the end-to-end data necessary to provide that level of candidate transparency.And it is likely that most of these stand-alone vendors won\\xe2\\x80\\x99t be independent for long. Analysts across the industry predict that the big firms are going to begin another buying spree as they eye the accomplishments of these independent recruiting tech firms. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cOver the next 12 months we will see another wave of acquisitions where the upstart recruiting providers will get swallowed up,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Beebe said.It isn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t something customers need to worry about, but they should keep it in mind. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cYou want to choose tools that will solve your problems today, while keeping an eye on the future,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he said. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cThere is a great wave of innovation going on \\xe2\\x80\\x94 but you don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t want to sign any five-year contracts.\\xe2\\x80\\x9dTags: human resources, recruiting\\xc2\\xa9 2017 Workforce Magazine.'],\n",
       " ['SubscribeBack IssuesContributeAdvertisebyAmy WhytePhoto courtesy of Thinkstock.Elise Perazzini is about to enter the workforce.A college senior studying political science at Bucknell University, Perazzini is approaching graduation, after which she hopes to begin a career in marketing. But it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s not just about finding a job \\xe2\\x80\\x94 it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s about finding the right job.\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI am not just looking for a job, but a career,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Perazzini said.Many of her peers feel the same way, taking an increasingly serious attitude toward their future professional lives. A new survey by Adecco Staffing USA reveals that, more than ever, young job seekers are prioritizing job stability and growth opportunities when evaluating potential employment options.Rich Thompson, chief human resources officer at Adecco Group North America, said this shift in attitude is likely a result of the economic climate this generation grew up in.\\xe2\\x80\\x9cThey probably have parents or friends or family who\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve been through the downturn and lost their jobs,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Thompson said. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cAnd as a result, they\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve put more emphasis on security.\\xe2\\x80\\x9dThe survey, which included 1,001 college students ages 18 to 24, found that 70 percent of respondents would prefer a stable job without a high level of emotional investment or passion over a job with lots of passion but no job security.

An HSA is one of the smartest ways to save for medical expenses.\\xe2\\x80\\x9dBarnett may be somewhat unique in terms of retirement savings habits for his age group because he\\xe2\\x80\\x99s on the younger side of the millennial generation. But more companies are trying to curb health benefit costs by turning tohigh-deductible health care plans. That\\xe2\\x80\\x99s why many people are starting to see health savings accounts, which can be attached to these plans, as another way to save for retirement health care bills.\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t really need the money now, so why not save it?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Barnett, who named his new company Cleverly Engaged Marketing. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI\\xe2\\x80\\x99m using my 401(k) and my HSA to save for the future and to lower my taxable income.\\xe2\\x80\\x9dHighway to High-DeductibleJust as the retirement savings burden has shifted to employees with 401(k)s from employer-sponsored defined benefit pension plans, health care costs are moving as well. Nearly 17.4 million Americans had a high-deductible health plan with an HSA in 2014, and that number has been growing at a rate of about 15 percent annually since 2011, according to America\\xe2\\x80\\x99s Health Insurance Plans\\xe2\\x80\\x99 Center for Policy and Research.\\xc2\\xa0Money in the accounts has grown as well. As of June 2014, HSAs held $22.8 billion compared with $18.1 billion in June 2013, according to Minneapolis-based health care consulting group Devenir Group.\\xc2\\xa0The transfer of responsibility has happened because employers need to combat health care inflation, said Liz Ryan, head of health benefit services for Wells Fargo & Co.\\xe2\\x80\\x9cOver recent years, we\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve seen major increases in health care expenses,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Ryan said. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cEmployers have had to make tough decisions on how to provide benefits.\\xe2\\x80\\x9dThe shift to high-deductible health care plans has brought about the added bonus HSAs provide in helping users save for future health bills.\\xe2\\x80\\x9cAt first people were concerned about what they were losing\\xe2\\x80\\x9d with traditional health care plans, said Todd Berkley, president of HSA Consulting Services in Minnetonka, Minnesota. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cNow some people are looking at this as a long-term [health care savings] vehicle, which has short-term advantages if you need it.\\xe2\\x80\\x9dHSAs are like 401(k) medical expense accounts for people in high-deductible health care plans. Often when companies offer high-deductible plans, HSAs are paired alongside. For 2015, individuals can contribute up to $3,350, while families can put in $6,650.\\xc2\\xa0Some employers offer 401(k)-like incentives for participants by matching contributions or starting accounts off with seed money. From January to June last year, employers contributed 37.3 percent of all dollars in HSA accounts with the average employer contribution being $1,123, according to Devenir research.HSAs carry a triple tax bonus: Money goes in tax-free, gains on investments are not taxed, and funds taken out for many medical costs aren\\xe2\\x80\\x99t taxed either. Defined contribution plans get taxed at some point; regular 401(k)s tax withdrawals at retirement and Roth 401(k)s tax contributionswhile workers are trying to save. They are different from other employee-directed health savings accounts because assets can be invested, employees own their accounts and balances roll over to the next year.There are a few snags with HSAs overall. First, in order to have an account, workers need to have a qualifying high-deductible health plan. Next, workers covered by other insurance or Medicare or Medicaid are not eligible. Plus, there\\xe2\\x80\\x99s the confusion with the acronyms associated with the various accounts tied to health plans in general.Seeing GrowthHSAs have been around for more than a decade, but it has taken a while for employers and their workers to understand them.At first, HSAs were seen as a debit system to pay for health costs.Today, while it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s hard to determine whether users are saving dollars for retirement, accounts are growing annually.\\xc2\\xa0\\xe2\\x80\\x9cPeople are first understanding the compelling message that we are going to live longer,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Bob Kaiser, head of health benefit solutions for Bank of America Merrill Lynch. HSAs are a way \\xe2\\x80\\x9cto stash away sizable cash today.\\xe2\\x80\\x9dPeople do need to save, Kaiser said. According to Fidelity Investments, health care will most likely be the largest expense in retirement. Last year, Fidelity reported that a 65-year-old couple who retired in 2014 will need an average $220,000 to cover medical bills in retirement.\\xe2\\x80\\x9cThe question is how do people get there?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Kevin McKechnie, executive director of the HSA Council at the American Bankers Association. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cHSA is the only health care plan that allows you to pay for [health care] expenses today and save over time.\\xe2\\x80\\x9dIt sounds great, but with a maximum contribution level of $3,350 for individuals and $6,650 for families, it seems difficult to reach the amount Fidelity recommends. But data from the Employee Benefit Research Institute say that while it may be tough, people can save significantly.A person contributing the maximum allowed to their account for 40 years could save $360,000 using a 2.5 percent rate of return on investments, EBRI data show. Savings could jump to $600,000 if investments earned 5 percent each year and nearly $1.1 million if 7.5 percent could be made. One major catch: HSA participants can\\xe2\\x80\\x99t take any money out for health bills.\\xe2\\x80\\x9cMany individuals may not have the means to both save in an HSA and pay their out-of-pocket health care expenses,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Paul Fronstin, the director of EBRI\\xe2\\x80\\x99s health research and education program, in the institute\\xe2\\x80\\x99s July report. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cAlso, HSA balances may not be sufficient to pay all medical expenses in retirement even if maximum contributions are made for 40 years.\\xe2\\x80\\x9dBut strides are being made and more money is accumulating and being invested in HSA accounts, said Eric Remjeske, Devenir\\xe2\\x80\\x99s president. Devenir 2014 data show from January to June, participants kept 44 percent of contributions in their accounts, only taking out $8.5 billion of the $15.1 billion contributed.\\xc2\\xa0America\\xe2\\x80\\x99s Health Insurance Plans\\xe2\\x80\\x99 Center for Policy and Research data show that workers who have had an HSA for eight years keep an average balance of $8,453. In many cases, once an account reaches a certain minimum amount (typically $1,000 to $2,000), participants can transfer the rest to investment accounts.Devenir data show a steady percentage increase of assets in investments, from 7 percent in 2006 to 13 percent in 2014.\\xe2\\x80\\x9cIndividuals are looking at how they use these accounts and save to maximize options,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Remjeske said. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cIt has been an evolution in thinking. It has taken time for people to learn how to use it.\\xe2\\x80\\x9dIn 2011, Sunovion Pharmaceuticals Inc. introduced a high-deductible health plan and gave employees a choice between enrolling in it or a traditional health plan. That year, 11 percent of the Marlborough, Massachusetts-based company\\xe2\\x80\\x99s workforce chose the high-deductible plan; in 2014, that number rose to 58 percent.Last year, the company contributed $900 to individual and $1,800 to family accounts. Overall, participants had a total of $11 million in their HSAs and used $7 million for health bills. Participants who have more than $1,000 in their accounts can move the rest of their money into various stock and bond investments.\\xe2\\x80\\x9cPeople are now keeping balances. The money from the company is important to them and the power of contributing pretax dollars is huge,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Karen Rodrigues, Sunovion\\xe2\\x80\\x99s director of benefits and relocation. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cAcross the board, all age groups are paying attention to this.\\xe2\\x80\\x9dRodrigues said employees like the control they have over their health care dollars while the company enjoys seeing health care costs run below national norms.\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI hear a lot of people saying, \\xe2\\x80\\x98Why should I give my money to premiums that I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll never use? I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll keep the money myself,\\xe2\\x80\\x99 \\xe2\\x80\\x9d Rodrigues said. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cIt has opened up their eyes and they\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve become better consumers.\\xe2\\x80\\x9dPatty Kujawa is a writer based in Milwaukee.

Hiring mistakes are even costlier.According to a 2012 report from the Center for American Progress, the typical cost to replace a worker making between $30,000 and $75,000 is about 20 percent of that worker\\xe2\\x80\\x99s salary. Talk about pressing your luck. Those are big bucks and potentially a double whammy if the worker doesn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t work out.But when the right person is found, the question becomes: \\xe2\\x80\\x9cWhen can you start?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\xe2\\x80\\x9cUm, yesterday?\\xe2\\x80\\x9dKnowing that, many of you will probably guffaw, grunt and grumble at the following suggestion: Why not offer workers a \\xe2\\x80\\x9cpre-cation?\\xe2\\x80\\x9dIn other words, give them \\xe2\\x80\\x9cthe dessert\\xe2\\x80\\x9d before the meal \\xe2\\x80\\x94 a paid vacation before the first day on the job.

He wound up taking the job. And according to Freedman, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cIt was only a couple of weeks, but he [the worker] just came in so refreshed and energized, it was amazing.\\xe2\\x80\\x9dThat\\xe2\\x80\\x99s what I call a \\xe2\\x80\\x9ctwo-week notice.\\xe2\\x80\\x9dSo what happened there? Not only was the pre-cation a great recruiting tool, but also it allowed the top recruit a chance to come in with added incentive to please \\xe2\\x80\\x94 he got paid vacation time just for accepting a job, and my guess is he wanted to show the company he deserved it \\xe2\\x80\\x94 and energy to burn.There are two sides to every story. Chances are job candidates are exhausted, too, whether it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s from pressures at a current job or pressures from finding a new job. A recharge could do wonders for the worker and for the worker\\xe2\\x80\\x99s productivity.To help the current crew cope, offer to help them decide which projects are priorities, divvy up job duties fairly until the cavalry gets there, and offer them some extra time off when things settle down to acknowledge they\\xe2\\x80\\x99re taking on extra work.So go make it happen \\xe2\\x80\\x94 like yesterday.\\xc2\\xa9 2017 Workforce Magazine.'],\n",

Four years ago, however, GM college executives started hearing rumblings from dealers that hiring qualified entry-level techs was becoming a challenge.\\xe2\\x80\\x9cThere is tremendous competition for technicians in the marketplace,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Sancya said in an email. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cAll you have to do is look at technician job postings on SimplyHired or Indeed. Dealers are offering signing bonuses and a wide variety of other incentives never seen before in our industry.

Executives determined that training is a key component to enlisting and retaining quality candidates, so it was time to start a recruiting push. They quickly bolstered the existing GM Automotive Service Educational Program technician pipeline, launched a new service department job role and created new technician pipelines to accelerate the availability of trained techs to meet the shortage.To date, the initiative is rapidly filling the pipeline, Sancya said.

       " ['SubscribeBack IssuesContributeAdvertisebyLara WalshJamie Migdal has a bone to pick with recruiting for the pet care industry.Despite tremendous growth and increased revenue from consumer spending during the 20 years she has been in the business, the young industry has been held back in talent management by antiquated recruitment practices, Migdal said.\\xe2\\x80\\x9cThe pet industry is fragmented and generally technologically unsophisticated. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s a relatively new industry that\\xe2\\x80\\x99s seen most of its growth over the last decade, and it hasn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t figured out how to deal with human resource issues,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d she said.Migdal wants to change that. She hopes to use lessons from human resources in her newest company FetchFind, which aims to help pet-care businesses dig up candidates who have experience dealing with animals.The field\\xe2\\x80\\x99s biggest problems? The industry\\xe2\\x80\\x99s high turnover rates are crippling. She estimates it to be at 200 percent \\xe2\\x80\\x94 and unsophisticated methods of finding new employees like Craigslist ads makes onboarding good employees who specialize in pet care difficult.\\xc2\\xa0\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve been in this space hiring for so many years, and all of my clients were coming to me saying, \\xe2\\x80\\x98Our biggest spending point is hiring. We can\\xe2\\x80\\x99t find good people, we don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t know how to identify the good people with the traditional outlets for sourcing candidates, i.e., Craigslist, Monster and word-of-mouth,\\xe2\\x80\\x99 \\xe2\\x80\\x9d Migdal said.She added, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cThose things just have a very limited shelf life, and there is no way of truly understanding someone\\xe2\\x80\\x99s background because many people applying through those jobs are really looking for any job, not just pet-specific ones.\\xe2\\x80\\x9dOne wouldn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t think that there would be a shortage of pet-specific job candidates. According to research from The Children\\xe2\\x80\\x99s Mutual, a U.K.-based company that specializes in saving and investments for children, kids really want to work with animals. One of the most popular professions that children ages 5 and 6 say they aspire to be when they grow up is a veterinarian.But fast-forward a couple of decades, and things are different. On average, veterinarians, for instance, don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t get paid nearly as much as family practitioners and pediatricians, who are among the lowest-paid doctors. And jobs grooming and \\xe2\\x80\\x9csitting\\xe2\\x80\\x9d for pets are considered even more undesirable, Migdal said.\\xe2\\x80\\x9cPeople think of working with pets as being, if you can\\xe2\\x80\\x99t do anything else, you either wait tables or you work with animals. That\\xe2\\x80\\x99s not really the way that it should be,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Migdal said. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cIt takes a particular skill set.\\xe2\\x80\\x9dThis mentality exists despite numbers showing that the pet industry is one of the largest and fastest-growing industries in the United States. According to the American Pet Products Association, Americans are expected to spend almost $60 billion on pet industry services and goods this year.This growth has brought with it plenty of opportunities for more jobs with the increased demand for pet products and services. Dog groomers make on average $10.58 per hour and the average wage for a dog-sitter is $10.50 per hour.Migdal said that businesses that require one-to-one contact with pets usually have the highest turnover rates because they are typically lower-paid and have less barrier to entry, meaning employers in the pet industry experience a huge influx of candidates who want those types of jobs, but most of these pet-care job hunters have not worked with pets before and don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t have any experience.\\xe2\\x80\\x9cMany employers will kind of just take what they can get and cross their fingers.\\xe2\\x80\\x9dLaurren Darr, founder of the International Association of Pet Fashion Professionals, said it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s very common for pet employers to get applications from candidates with no relevant experience.\\xe2\\x80\\x9cMany people do not realize that designing clothing for pets is very different than designing for a baby or for adults,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Darr said. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cDifferent considerations must be made for materials and fabrics, even for smaller vs. larger dogs.\\xe2\\x80\\x9dFetchFind hopes to use online training modules and a system of certifications and specialty-dependent badges to transform the field, both for people serious about working in the pet industry and for employers who want reliable and qualified employees.Anani Lawson who owns Philadelphia-based Royal Cat Boutique said he would seriously consider hiring a social media expert for the company if he had confidence in finding a qualified candidate with an obvious passion for working with pets.\\xe2\\x80\\x9cYou wouldn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t be worried about an employee being all talk,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Anani said. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cYou\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll be able to find someone you know will be good and will be able to work with pets.\\xe2\\x80\\x9dMigdal hopes to change this uncertainty with her HR-based approach.\\xe2\\x80\\x9cWhat I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m looking to do is to create a high level of prestige and bring some professionalism to the pet industry by creating a networking space.\\xe2\\x80\\x9dLara Walsh is a Workforce editorial intern.

Courtesy of the Library of Congress.In 2007, Dow Chemical Co. followed the trend of many companies and froze its traditional pension plan. But in an unusual move, Dow used the power of a 2006 law to become one of the first large companies to adopt a hybrid, or cash-balance defined benefit plan, instead of creating or boosting an existing 401(k) plan for workers.Dow closed the old plan and opened the new one for several reasons, said Janet Boyd, Dow\\xe2\\x80\\x99s director of government relations, tax and benefits. Modern workers don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t stay in their jobs for decades like they used to, and workers like to see an account balance similar to what is shown in a 401(k) plan. Dow used the flexibility of the new rules to create a benefit that dovetailed with the needs of its workers.Plus, the 2006 law, called the Pension Protection Act, updated issues not seen in the original legislation that was passed several decades earlier.It \\xe2\\x80\\x9cprovided clearer rules in how a hybrid plan could be designed,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Boyd said. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cWe felt it was helpful to take advantage of the new rules.\\xe2\\x80\\x9dAnd that flexibility is what the founding law of retirement plans \\xe2\\x80\\x94 the Employee Retirement Income Security Act \\xe2\\x80\\x94 has been attempting to accomplish since it was passed 40 years ago under the Ford administration. No doubt there have been missteps, but the original law and subsequent rulings have helped the industry develop, allowing millions of U.S. workers to participate in and benefit from a regulated retirement system. In 2011, U.S. Labor Department statistics show 683,647 retirement plans in America compared with 311,094 in 1975.\\xe2\\x80\\x9cThe law was a piece of art,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Kevin Wagner, senior consultant at Towers Watson & Co. Lawmakers \\xe2\\x80\\x9cdid such a great job of dealing with issues that we don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t have anymore.\\xe2\\x80\\x9dIt was Labor Day \\xe2\\x80\\x94 Sept. 2, 1974 \\xe2\\x80\\x94 when President Gerald Ford signed ERISA into law. For the past 40 years, employers who offer retirement plans have had to promise workers certain rights and protections.\\xe2\\x80\\x9cERISA isn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t perfect, but I still think the concept works, and the basic principle still makes sense,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Boyd said.Standard CoverageAt its core, ERISA\\xe2\\x80\\x99s intent was to secure U.S. workers\\xe2\\x80\\x99 retirement money. It set standards for coverage, meaning who was able to participate; vesting, or how long people needed to work before getting benefits; and minimum funding. Now employers or plan sponsors have to make decisions that are in the best interests of their participants.Before the law, companies with pension plans could use money set aside for benefits for other purposes. Companies could also close an underfunded plan without owing participants any money.The turning point for federal oversight happened when Studebaker-Packard Corp. closed its South Bend, Indiana, plant in 1963. The company had an underfunded pension plan, thousands of workers walked out with less than 15 percent of their retirement benefit, and some got nothing at all.\\xe2\\x80\\x9cWhen Studebaker failed, that became the rally cry that created the political impetus to do something,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Ann Combs, former assistant secretary of labor for pensions during the George W. Bush administration and now head of government relations for investment company Vanguard Group. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cIt was a legendary company that everybody knew, and it failed.\\xe2\\x80\\x9dFor the first few years after ERISA\\xe2\\x80\\x99s passage, the number of defined benefit plans grew, and by 1980 nearly 36 million private-sector workers, or 46 percent of the private-sector workforce, was covered by this kind of plan, according to data from the Employee Benefit Research Institute. With defined benefit plans, employers define the benefit based on a predetermined formula. The employer funds and invests the money, and the payout is typically an annuity.In the 1980s, Congress and the Reagan administration fiddled with funding rules for over- and underfunded plans as well as changed the premium structure for the insurance agency, the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corp., which was set up to backstop defined benefit plans. Tightening funding rules meant fewer tax-free dollars in pension plans and more taxable dollars in the economy.Translation: while Congress was able to give Americans tax breaks on their income, these new laws gave plan sponsors no incentive to prepare for hard times.Virus Alert\\xe2\\x80\\x9cCongress in the 1980s and early \\xe2\\x80\\x9990s discouraged the very purpose of the law, which was to get benefits funded,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Sylvester Schieber, an author who is the former chairman of the Social Security Advisory Board and the retired director of retirement research at Towers Watson. Plan sponsors \\xe2\\x80\\x9cwere caught in this calamity and said they can\\xe2\\x80\\x99t do this, so they started closing plans.\\xe2\\x80\\x9dIt was the virus that infected defined benefit plans, Towers Watson\\xe2\\x80\\x99s Wagner said.In 1983, there were 175,143 defined benefit plans, Labor Department statistics show. By 1992, there were only 88,621. In 2011, that number shrank to 45,256.\\xe2\\x80\\x9cCongress may have received short-term tax value, but it really essentially destroyed the defined benefit system,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Wagner said. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cThe ability to have a secure retirement is much more tenuous today than it was 30 years ago.\\xe2\\x80\\x9dThe U.S. workforce was changing, too. A more mobile workforce was evolving, and the years it took to qualify for traditional benefits didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t suit many employees. Statistics from a 2012 Bureau of Labor Statistics report showed that workers born between 1957 and 1964 have held an average of 11 jobs during their prime working years.Employers started realizing they didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t want to take on all the responsibility of a pension plan, but still wanted to offer a tax-deferred retirement savings plan. It wasn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t until 1981 when the U.S. Internal Revenue Service\\xe2\\x80\\x99s regulation under Section 401(k) made it clear that portions of workers\\xe2\\x80\\x99 regular salaries could be contributed to secondary savings plans on a tax-deferred basis.The popularity of the employer-sponsored, but employee-funded 401(k), or defined contribution plan, took off. The number of defined contribution plans more than doubled in a decade\\xe2\\x80\\x99s time to 599,245 in 1990 from 340,805 taxable plans in 1980.\\xc2\\xa0A shift was definitely taking place.\\xe2\\x80\\x9cYes, it was overregulation. Yes, it was continued effects of policymakers using pension funds [tax-preferred status] as a source of revenue, but it was also a trend that reflected a dramatically changing workforce as well as all the positive aspects of a vibrant defined contribution system,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Jim Klein, president of the American Benefits Council.Employees liked the plans, too. By 2000, 51 million people participated in a defined contribution plan compared with the 22 million who took part in a defined benefit plan. There were 687,000 defined contribution plans with $2.9 trillion in assets compared with 49,000 defined benefit plans with $2 trillion in assets, according to the Investment Company Institute.Since 1985, more contributions have flowed into defined contribution plans on an annual basis than defined benefit, Labor Department figures show.\\xe2\\x80\\x9cThe savings rates were far more robust than anyone anticipated,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Schieber said. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cAs a result, the state of the DC system is far more robust than it is being given credit for.\\xe2\\x80\\x9dAs defined contribution plans grew and have become the main way people save for retirement, the industry has tried to put defined benefit aspects into 401(k) plans. The typical 401(k) plan in the \\xe2\\x80\\x9990s had workers signing up, looking at prospectuses and deciding how much and where to invest. In many ways, workers were expected to be professional money managers, and there was concern and evidence that they weren\\xe2\\x80\\x99t doing too well.In 2006, Congress passed the Pension Protection Act. The law helped plan sponsors automate a lot of the decisions for workers, making it easier to save. It also cleared up rules on the defined benefit side for companies like Dow Chemical to set up cash balance plans.\\xe2\\x80\\x9cIt was a recognition that most people were going to be saving through defined contribution,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Combs, who headed the Labor Department\\xe2\\x80\\x99s pension division when the law was passed. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cIt was about trying to put the plan to work for the participant.\\xe2\\x80\\x9dMore than half of plans surveyed in 2013 by the Callan Investments Institute automatically enroll participants; of that group, 87 percent automatically bump worker contributions annually. As of December 2013, defined contribution plans held $5.9 trillion in assets, dwarfing the $3 trillion defined benefit market.Even though there are $23 trillion in total retirement assets today, many wonder whether America has saved enough money to last through retirement. There are forces in play that seem to be repeating the past mistakes discouraging Americans to save as much as possible. Last year, President Barack Obama proposed to limit the amount workers could save from all types of retirement accounts. Congress, too, is eyeing the tax-preferred status of plans to possibly help solve the country\\xe2\\x80\\x99s growing deficit problem.Maybe we should look at the past to see what happens when Congress tinkers with the tax benefits of retirement plans, Schieber said.\\xe2\\x80\\x9cEither we have to start paying for services or reduce what we spend, and quit robbing future retirees of their ability to save,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he added.Patty Kujawa is a writer based in Milwaukee.

I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m Jewish and my wife is Catholic, and we wanted our ceremony to blend the best of both traditions.While my wife\\xe2\\x80\\x99s dream wedding included her dad walking her down a church aisle, we were willing to sacrifice if we could not find a priest and a rabbi who would accommodate our wishes. With nervous trepidation, we met with the priest of Colleen\\xe2\\x80\\x99s parish, who, as it turned out, was 100 percent on board with our plan. We next found a rabbi, and all of us worked together to craft the ceremony we wanted: in a church, under a chuppah, with a beautiful blend of both religions and our respective traditions and customs.I tell this story because, recently, the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission filed a lawsuit against a company that fired employees who refused to worship the employer\\xe2\\x80\\x99s religion of choice \\xe2\\x80\\x94 which happened to be the worship of an onion.According to the EEOC, United Health Programs of America and its parent company, Cost Containment Group, required its employees to participate in \\xe2\\x80\\x9cgroup prayers, candle burning and discussions of spiritual texts,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d all as part of a \\xe2\\x80\\x9cbelief system\\xe2\\x80\\x9d that the defendants\\xe2\\x80\\x99 family member created, called \\xe2\\x80\\x9cOnionhead.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d The EEOC further alleges that employees who refused to participate were fired.What is Onionhead? According to the Harnessing Happiness Foundation, Onionhead is not a \\xe2\\x80\\x9cwhat\\xe2\\x80\\x9d but a \\xe2\\x80\\x9cwho.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\xe2\\x80\\x9cHe wants everyone to know how they feel and then know what to do with those feelings. He helps us direct our emotions in a truthful and compassionate way. Which in turn assists us to communicate more appropriately and peacefully. In turn, we then approach life from a place of our wellness rather than a place of our wounds.\\xe2\\x80\\x9dI\\xe2\\x80\\x99m not making this up. This comes right from the website of the Harnessing Happiness Foundation, which is a legitimate 501(c)3 nonprofit organization. It is \\xe2\\x80\\x9cdedicated to emotional knowledge and intelligence, conflict resolution and life handling skills, for all ages,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d which teaches the belief that \\xe2\\x80\\x9chope lies in our ability to deal with problems in a respectful, mindful and loving way.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\xe2\\x80\\x9cOnionhead\\xe2\\x80\\x9d is part of Harnessing Happiness, which uses a genderless onion \\xe2\\x80\\x9cas a medium to express peeling our feelings, as a way of healing our feelings.\\xe2\\x80\\x9dFor its part, the Harnessing Happiness Foundation denies that Onionhead is a religious practice.Here\\xe2\\x80\\x99s the thing. For purposes of the EEOC\\xe2\\x80\\x99s religious discrimination lawsuit, it doesn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t matter whether Onionhead is a bona fide \\xe2\\x80\\x9creligion.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d According to the regulations interpreting Title VII\\xe2\\x80\\x99s religious discrimination provisions, \\xe2\\x80\\x9creligious practices \\xe2\\x80\\xa6 include moral or ethical beliefs as to what is right and wrong which are sincerely held with the strength of traditional religious views.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d According to the Harnessing Happiness Foundation\\xe2\\x80\\x99s website, Onionhead appears to include sincerely held moral or ethical beliefs about what is right and wrong. Thus, it appears that, even though Onionhead\\xe2\\x80\\x99s leaders deny its status as a religion, Title VII likely concludes otherwise.What does all this mean for you? Leave religion out of the workplace. Whatever you call your deity \\xe2\\x80\\x94 God, Jesus, Allah, Buddah or even Onionhead \\xe2\\x80\\x94 leave it at home. The workplace and religion do not mix. An employer cannot force its employees to conform to, follow or practice the employer\\xe2\\x80\\x99s chosen religious practices and beliefs.This case illustrates a deeper point: Employers seem to have forgotten how to accommodate. People are quick to lay blame at the feet of companies that fail to accommodate their employees\\xe2\\x80\\x99 differing religious views, or worse, force their own religious views upon their employees.Yet, teaching how to accommodate starts at home. If children learn exclusion, how can we expect them to act any differently as adults? If nothing else, I know my kids (being raised Catholic, but with a healthy dose of Jewish tradition in the home) should not make these mistakes as they grow.

       " ['SubscribeBack IssuesContributeAdvertisebyLadan NikravanMany older Americans, stung by a recession that shattered investments and home values, have accepted the reality of a less financially secure retirement that comes later in life. As the golden years approach, they also are discovering that they are unprepared and increasingly concerned about health care costs after leaving the workplace.Research from Fidelity Investments\\xe2\\x80\\x99 \\xe2\\x80\\x9c2013 Retirement Savings Assessment\\xe2\\x80\\x9d study released in March suggests that while 84 percent of pre-retirees (ages 55 to 64) wonder whether they\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll be able to cover health expenses during retirement, many greatly underestimate the amount of savings they will need. The study indicated that 48 percent of respondents believe they will need about $50,000 to pay for their individual health care costs in retirement. In contrast, Fidelity\\xe2\\x80\\x99s annual retiree health care cost estimate found that the average couple should expect to spend more than $220,000 in health care expenses over the course of their retirement, the same figure Fidelity reported last year.According to Fidelity, retirees now spend more on health care than they do on food. If that trend continues, health care will be retirees\\xe2\\x80\\x99 second-largest expense in just a few years, with housing holding the top spot.

Will I have Medicare?\\xe2\\x80\\x99 \\xe2\\x80\\x9dArthur Noonan, senior partner in the retirement business at Mercer, said less than 20 percent of companies provide retirement health care, and while baby boomers see how big of an issue this was for their parents, they\\xe2\\x80\\x99re not thinking about it themselves.\\xe2\\x80\\x9cEmployees in that age bracket have a direct line of sight with the aging parent issue,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he said. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cThey see how unprepared their parents were, but they\\xe2\\x80\\x99re not thinking, \\xe2\\x80\\x98This is going to be me in 20 years.\\xe2\\x80\\x99 They need to take action, but they\\xe2\\x80\\x99re not, and companies aren\\xe2\\x80\\x99t always helping them take the next steps.\\xe2\\x80\\x9dAt The Schwan Food Co., a Marshall, Minnesota-based frozen-food company, Chief Human Resources Officer Scott Peterson said it has implemented two programs designed to help employees meet health and financial retirement goals. Schwan recently announced an employee profit-sharing retirement plan that provides additional savings for employees and serves as a sign-up incentive for those not using the 401(k).Schwan also moved to a consumer-driven health plan in 2013. Peterson saw that 60 percent of the company\\xe2\\x80\\x99s employees over the age of 40 contribute to their health savings account.

       " ['SubscribeBack IssuesContributeAdvertisebyPatty KujawaGinger Hathaway just landed her first job with an employer that offers a 401(k). She is 58 years old and has been working since she was a teenager.Most of her jobs have been at restaurants where a 401(k) or other kind of retirement savings plan wasn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t offered, Hathaway said. She hasn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t saved anything for her later years, mostly because she has been a single mother for more than a decade and is focused on paying two college tuitions.Even though her new employer will contribute to her 401(k), Hathaway said she can\\xe2\\x80\\x99t afford to put dollars in it right now. She may be able to contribute in a few months if she gets promoted.\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll be working until I die,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Hathaway, who lives in Wisconsin. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t really blame anyone or anything. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s just the cards I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve been dealt.\\xe2\\x80\\x9dHer story has a familiar tone for many Americans, statistics show. Less than half of working Americans have access to today\\xe2\\x80\\x99s No. 1 retirement vehicle: a 401(k) plan. Many who have a 401(k) at work opt not to participate, and many who do contribute often don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t save enough.\\xe2\\x80\\x9cWe have less of a culture of thrift than we used to,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Mathew Greenwald, president and CEO of research firm Greenwald & Associates.According to the Employee Benefit Research Institute\\xe2\\x80\\x99s 24th annual Retirement Confidence Survey, only 45 percent of all workers say they have a 401(k) plan at their workplace. And while for the first time the survey showed an increase in respondents who are confident they will have enough money to last throughout their retirement (18 percent), only 11 percent have $250,000 or more. A whopping 36 percent have less than $1,000 saved, an 8 percentage point increase from last year.It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s clear not every American is saving for retirement, but does that mean the retirement industry has failed everyone? After all, when access to plans at work and adequate savings are at issue, the big picture doesn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t look that great.\\xe2\\x80\\x9cThe people have failed, not the industry,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Chad Parks, president and CEO of The Online 401(k), a retirement plan provider serving primarily midsize to small employers. With individual retirement accounts available, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cThere\\xe2\\x80\\x99s not a lack of tools or access,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he said. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cIt\\xe2\\x80\\x99s a lack of people saving. People have taken their eyes off their personal responsibility of saving.\\xe2\\x80\\x9dBut Steven Sass, a research economist at the Center for Retirement Research at Boston College, said he wouldn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t give the industry a passing grade. Sass said for those who have access to plans, the information participants and plan sponsors receive is still too technical and overwhelming for many. Because many workers are ill-equipped to make investment decisions, it may be the reason people who aren\\xe2\\x80\\x99t automatically enrolled into plans don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t participate.Developing a HabitThe focus, Sass said, should be on developing a habit of saving over a long period of time and investing in target-date funds, which are funds where investments become more conservative as the participant ages.\\xe2\\x80\\x9cVery few people know how much they will need in retirement,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Sass said. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cWhat\\xe2\\x80\\x99s more important is how long and how much you save. The industry is still focusing more on investments and picking mutual funds.\\xe2\\x80\\x9dBut many industry experts say there is a lot that is working.Retirement plans overall held $23 trillion in assets at the end of 2013, a 15.6 percent increase from December 2012, according to the latest figures from the Investment Company Institute, a Washington-based association that represents U.S. investment companies. A good bit of that precipitous climb has come from employers adopting automatic features and using target-date funds.Bank of America Merrill Lynch\\xe2\\x80\\x99s 401(k) Wellness Scorecard showed nearly half of plan sponsors eligible to use auto enrollment do so, increasing their numbers by 16 percent in 2013; increasing contributions automatically went up 25 percent compared with the previous year. In addition, when combined with offering advice, employees were more likely to have better participation and saving rates, the March study found.\\xe2\\x80\\x9cAutomatic features have really pushed the needle by capturing upon participants\\xe2\\x80\\x99 inertia,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Kathleen Kelly, managing partner at Compass Financial Partners in Greensboro, North Carolina. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cWe are also seeing a much greater interest from plan sponsors to help put building blocks together to enable participants to make the right decisions.\\xe2\\x80\\x9dEBRI data are also showing positive signs that 401(k) plans work well for people who use these accounts for the long haul. About 86 percent of low-income workers would get at least 60 percent of their pay in retirement at age 64 if they stay in a 401(k) plan for at least 30 years and if Social Security payouts remain the same, EBRI data show. Higher wage earners would see similar benefits under the same circumstances.\\xe2\\x80\\x9cFor those people eligible for a 401(k) plan over a substantial number of years, we are finding large account balances,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Jack VanDerhei, EBRI\\xe2\\x80\\x99s research director.\\xc2\\xa0Sass said the industry is trying to make today\\xe2\\x80\\x99s defined contribution plans act like their predecessor, defined benefit plans \\xe2\\x80\\x94 both of which he thinks are outdated. The defined benefit plan, often a pension, is a retirement benefit that promises a monthly payment in retirement that is typically pulled from a formula based on an employee\\xe2\\x80\\x99s age, years of service and final salary. In general, the strategy behind offering a defined benefit plan was to keep workers at their jobs for long periods of time to avoid retraining new workers, then to get them to retire in a timely fashion. But these plans are rare in today\\xe2\\x80\\x99s workforce.The Bank of America Merrill Lynch study shows that more 401(k) plans use automatic features that help these accounts act like defined benefit plans. Like those plans, little is expected from participants in 401(k) plans that use auto features; they are signed up automatically and if they are put into a target-date fund, they don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t have to think about an investment lineup. Unlike many defined benefit plans, participants must contribute, but there\\xe2\\x80\\x99s an automatic feature for that, too.Problems, SolutionsIt\\xe2\\x80\\x99s a great setup, but Sass said there are two problems: workers don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t stay at their jobs for years like they used to and not enough companies are offering 401(k) plans to cover every worker. Plus, because many Americans haven\\xe2\\x80\\x99t saved enough, workers remain on the job longer. Unlike the defined benefit plan where certain triggers \\xe2\\x80\\x94 such as number of years worked \\xe2\\x80\\x94 have been met, 401(k)s offer no real incentive to retire.It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s an outdated system, where many small employers offer plans only when it serves a purpose for themselves, Sass said, and he added that the U.S. system should be autonomous so every low- and high-income worker receives the same savings opportunity and benefit.\\xe2\\x80\\x9cSome of this doesn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t make sense anymore,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Sass said. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cWe need a system where everyone gets a tax benefit. That way we won\\xe2\\x80\\x99t have to bribe doctors and lawyers to give their secretaries a retirement plan.\\xe2\\x80\\x9dSass isn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t the only one thinking that employers should stop offering this as a voluntary benefit. To get everyone to save something for retirement, several states including California, Connecticut and Maryland have offered ideas promoting state-run retirement systems for private workers.President Barack Obama has offered his myRA plan, a starter retirement savings bond account that is set up through the workplace. The president, who unveiled myRA in his 2014 State of the Union Address, said these accounts would be offered through employers, but managed by the U.S. Treasury Department. Because accounts would be invested in U.S.-backed savings bonds, savers would be guaranteed a decent return.And earlier this year, Sen. Tom Harkin, D-Iowa, introduced the Universal, Secure, Adaptable (USA) Retirement Funds Act, a mandatory retirement savings vehicle for employers that don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t have a retirement plan with an annuity option. Through the USA Retirement Fund, participants would automatically contribute 6 percent of pay at the start, and employers could contribute up to $5,000 per account annually. At retirement, participants would get an annuity, like a traditional defined benefit plan. The proposal has been referred to the Committee on Health, Education, Labor and Pensions of which Harkin is chairman.Most industry experts are in favor of voluntary plans that reach people who currently don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t have access at work, but not at the expense of the system that already benefits millions of Americans.\\xe2\\x80\\x9cThe idea behind myRA is positive because the bottom line is that we need to get more people covered,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Compass Financial\\xe2\\x80\\x99s Kelly said. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cBut there\\xe2\\x80\\x99s a lot already working in retirement, and there\\xe2\\x80\\x99s a positive momentum in terms of what plan sponsors have elected to do.\\xe2\\x80\\x9dParks added that even though it may be harder for midsize and small businesses to offer a 401(k) plan, there\\xe2\\x80\\x99s no good excuse anymore. Because of technology advances and new regulations, costs have dropped considerably. Employers may not understand that they don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t have to match employee contributions. Plus, employers can qualify for tax credits \\xe2\\x80\\x94 sometimes up to 50 percent of startup costs \\xe2\\x80\\x94 when introducing a retirement plan at work.\\xe2\\x80\\x9cWhen you run a small business, you have a lot you need to take care of, and there is an order of importance for all of it,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Parks said. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cUnfortunately retirement plans always seem to be the last thing they think about.\\xe2\\x80\\x9dTo get employers to think more positively about establishing retirement plans, current incentives need to stay in place. During the past year, the Obama administration has offered several proposals targeting the tax-preferred status of 401(k) plans that would help shore up the nation\\xe2\\x80\\x99s debt. Limiting how much can be saved in a tax-sheltered retirement plan discourages businesses from starting them, which would limit worker access to these accounts, experts say.\\xe2\\x80\\x9cThe desire to find revenue causes policymakers to look at the retirement sector, not as it should be, but more as an eye toward how much money can we take from the tax-preferred status of retirement plans,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Bradford Campbell, counsel at law firm Drinker Biddle & Reath, during a company webinar in March. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cHow you address tax incentives at the small business level could really impact how many plans there are, how available they are and the rules we operate under.\\xe2\\x80\\x9dPatty Kujawa is a writer based in Milwaukee.

       " ['SubscribeBack IssuesContributeAdvertisebyJulia MenchHuman resources executives have never seen more diverse, innovative technologies that support all aspects of an HR department.The cloud is helping app developers push the innovative envelope and rapidly bring new HR solutions to market. But the biggest challenge isn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t which technology to adopt; it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s the quality and relevancy of the data that powers these solutions.Organizations can put the coolest, easy-to-use, agile HR app in place, but if bad, irrelevant or out-of-date data supplies that technology, then they fail on both fronts. Ultimately this translates into little to no return on investment on the new technology, and the HR executive receives inconsistent, inaccurate results to drive their corporate strategy.Whether HR executives decide to stay the course with an older HR management system or rip and replace entirely, they have a rare chance to get their data right and provide long-term strategic worth for their department and the overall business.How do they accomplish this? Through the establishment of accurate data sets and proper governance processes, senior HR professionals can ensure data accuracy as the paramount outcome for informed decision-making.Establish One Source of \\xe2\\x80\\x98Truth\\xe2\\x80\\x99Whether HR systems have been in place for more than a decade, ever-changing because of an acquisition or because a company is introducing the newest app into its technology mix, different systems inevitably need to share and synchronize data with each other. One system may deal with recruiting while another holds enterprise resource planning information; these systems may be housed in differing geographic locations so information is updated at different times.HR executives must establish one global source of HR \\xe2\\x80\\x9ctruth\\xe2\\x80\\x9d to get an accurate and complete picture of the organization\\xe2\\x80\\x99s human assets. As data latency issues often occur with multiple systems, it is best to set up a universal information layer that captures the data at the same point in time on a regular basis \\xe2\\x80\\x94 ideally on a nightly basis. This practice optimizes recruiting and workforce decisions by ensuring that executives have access to consolidated, current HR data every day.While other industries have long relied on the knowledge and skills of data scientists, the world of HR has only recently begun leveraging their talents. Not only do they have access to hundreds of the latest analytics tools, but they understand the HR marketplace and can return meaningful reporting data on the most pivotal issues driving HR success.Data scientists can quickly produce sophisticated reports ranging from head count analysis to sales performance statistics and companywide benefits comparisons. They can also support recruiting efforts by helping to build profiles based on the most successful people at the organization who are currently in roles that need to be expanded. This type of exercise can provide valuable visibility into existing resources as well as potentially help HR executives identify opportunities for promotion from within their organization. HR data scientists can also help organizations examine and improve the quality of their baseline HR data.Get Going With GovernanceThe responsibility of managing changing HR data can be overwhelming without a proper governance structure in place. Well-defined data-ownership roles, responsibilities for managing the data and workflows are vital.This includes designating data stewards who are well-versed in the organization\\xe2\\x80\\x99s data environment and who understand the implemented technologies that can help identify and resolve issues quickly. HR leaders should also set up and automate a proper data error routing process so the right people automatically receive an email when errors pop up and can quickly correct them. Ideally, organizations should arrange for all HR data to synch up on a nightly basis to ensure that errors can be corrected immediately before affecting other areas downstream, e.g., payroll.New technology offerings often promise significant cost reduction and operational efficiencies, but HR executives must ensure the long-term integrity of their HR data to harness the power of these tools. Getting a proper data governance strategy and resources in place can substantially help HR teams get a leg up in leveraging technology to make sound business decisions for their overall organizations.Julia Mench is senior vice president of human capital management solutions at BackOffice Associates.

       " [\"SubscribeBack IssuesContributeAdvertisebySarah Fister GalePhoto courtesy of Sonru.Why bother interviewing candidates in person when you can have them answer questions on video and review their responses at your leisure?This is the argument made by vendors like Video Recruit, Sonru and Spark Hire Inc., which all offer automated interviewing technology. Recruiters send a list of interview questions to a candidate and have them record their responses remotely on camera.Collecting short video interviews with recruits can eliminate the time-consuming process of first-round, face-to-face interviews without giving up the opportunity to see those candidates in action. Rather than just reviewing r\\xc3\\xa9sum\\xc3\\xa9s or reading the results of an online questionnaire, video interviews let recruiters actually see how a candidate behaves and how well they know their content, said Lisa Rowan, an analyst at advisory firm IDC. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cIt allows them to ask open-ended, \\xe2\\x80\\x98Tell us about yourself\\xe2\\x80\\x99-style questions, that aren\\xe2\\x80\\x99t easy to write answers to.\\xe2\\x80\\x9dIt also adds flexibility for everyone involved. The candidate can record the video during their off-hours, and the recruiter can share it with any number of managers or team members who want to weigh in on the hiring decision. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cIt\\xe2\\x80\\x99s a great way to add efficiencies while still giving recruiters valuable information about the candidate,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Mike Durney, CEO of Dice Holdings Inc., which develops online recruiting websites.But there are downsides.\\xe2\\x80\\x9cIf a candidate\\xe2\\x80\\x99s first experience with your company is a request to do an automated video interview, it may not come off well,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Jim Wong, CEO and founder of Brilliant, a financial staffing company in Chicago.Wong is implementing video interviewing technology for temporary tech assignments where candidates are actively looking for work and shortening the time-to-fill those roles is critical. But he\\xe2\\x80\\x99s found that clients looking for permanent hires, and especially those interested in passive candidates, see more risk than value from an automated video interview step.\\xe2\\x80\\x9cIf I find a candidate who is happily employed, and I recruit them by saying, \\xe2\\x80\\x98I want you to go on video and answer four preset questions,\\xe2\\x80\\x99 that candidate won\\xe2\\x80\\x99t play along,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he said.What to AvoidRowan said to avoid asking questions that could inherently generate bias.\\xe2\\x80\\x9cAsking questions that elicit information about a candidate\\xe2\\x80\\x99s age, gender, family or sexual orientation could violate EEOC rules. Even if the information isn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t relevant to your ultimate hiring decision, having it could make you vulnerable to legal action,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d she said, referring to the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cThat kind of information doesn't come through on a r\\xc3\\xa9sum\\xc3\\xa9 or application.\\xe2\\x80\\x9dHowever, Rowan, noted that a video interview could send a positive message about the corporate culture because it is more personal than a written application or online assessment, and may appeal to younger recruits who use video in their daily lives. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cThey are acclimated to these tools so it will make sense to them,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d she said.For those companies, Rowan suggested tying video interviewing into a broader video-based recruiting approach, which could also include video segments on the career site with employees and executives talking about the company and corporate culture. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cThat way, when you ask them to do the video interview, it will feel more organic,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d she said.And use the tools thoughtfully.\\xe2\\x80\\x9cYou don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t want to be known as the company that uses automated interviewing to screen everyone,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Durney said. Video interviewing can be a great way to quickly assess a candidate pool and eliminate friction from the interview process, but it is still an automated tool that should be used in moderation.Sarah Fister Gale is a writer based in the Chicago area.

       " [\"SubscribeBack IssuesContributeAdvertisebyRick BellPhoto courtesy of Thinkstock.It's an age-old argument that organizations constantly grapple with: promote our next leader from within or hire someone from the outside?According to research by executive staffing firm Ferguson Partners, the health care industry not only is pursuing its new leadership from outside its walls, but also beyond the industry itself. Of those new chief executives, the survey noted, finance would provide 92 percent of the next generation of health care leaders. Some 55 percent would migrate from the hospitality industry, while 40 percent will come from investment firms and 33 percent from pharmaceutical companies.Nonetheless, industry knowledge appeared to be important to the 345 health care executives serving in various capacities who were surveyed. Respondents to the Ferguson Partners Healthcare Leaders Survey were cautious regarding the success a nonhealth care CEO could have vs. an industry veteran. The majority, 59 percent, said an outsider would be less effective. Just 17 percent said a hospital CEO hired from another industry would be equally effective as someone with health care experience and 9 percent thought an outsider could be more effective.Health care industry hiring trends were also part of the survey. Executives predicted the workforce will remain relatively stable in 2014. While 44 percent of respondents reported their overall staffing numbers were likely to decrease in 2014, 39 percent said they were likely to hire more staff and 16 percentanticipated their staffing levels would remain unchanged. No major layoffs or mass hirings were expected by any group.Hiring that does occur will focus on patient care and enterprise management with increases in care management (42 percent) followed by information management (41\\xc2\\xa0percent); clinical management (34 percent); operations management (26 percent); and general administration (24 percent).Rick Bell is Workforce's managing editor.

       " [\"SubscribeBack IssuesContributeAdvertisebyPatty KujawaThere's no doubt that America is saving for retirement. Today, nearly 80 million workers have $5.6 trillion in defined contribution plans alone. But whether workers are actually participating in sufficient numbers, saving enough and investing correctly \\xe2\\x80\\x94 all to retire comfortably \\xe2\\x80\\x94 well, that\\xe2\\x80\\x99s another story.The National Institute on Retirement Security claims the typical working-age household only has a few thousand dollars saved for retirement, and about 45 percent of the workforce has no retirement account funds. The institute\\xe2\\x80\\x99s research in June 2013 calls America\\xe2\\x80\\x99s abysmal retirement savings rate \\xe2\\x80\\x9cstaggering,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d and says the American dream of retiring comfortably will be more like a nightmare for workers and potentially employers.\\xe2\\x80\\x9cOur findings confirm that the American dream of retiring comfortably after a lifetime of work will be impossible for many,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Nari Rhee, author of the National Institute on Retirement Security report, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cThe Retirement Savings Crisis.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d \\xe2\\x80\\x9cEven when counting their entire net worth, 65 percent [of working Americans] still fall short.\\xe2\\x80\\x9dHow U.S. workers save today for retirement is clearly the issue for those hoping to enjoy their senior years as well as for employers wanting a workforce that doesn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t overextend its stay \\xe2\\x80\\x94 often referred to as the employee life cycle. And even though individual retirement accounts are available to everyone through various financial institutions, U.S. workers prefer to use what\\xe2\\x80\\x99s available at work: primarily defined contribution plans.Within the defined contribution arena, Americans held $4 trillion in 401(k) plans in the third quarter of 2013, according to the Investment Company Institute\\xe2\\x80\\x99s latest report.It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s a lot of money, but is it enough for retirees to last throughout their retirement? There are plenty of skeptics who say 401(k)s, which were primarily designed to supplement employer-driven defined benefit plans, are not a strong enough savings tool. But 401(k)s are the primary way workers save for retirement today, and they are getting a lot of attention from the industry to make sure these worker-funded accounts will create optimal results.\\xe2\\x80\\x9cFor those plan sponsors who have their goals established, and match their plan design to it, they can definitely get as many people as possible over the finish line as well as reach corporate goals,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Catherine Peterson, director of retirement insights at J.P. Morgan Asset Management.So how are U.S. workers with 401(k) accounts doing?Using a model that assumes workers would have at least 30 years in a 401(k) plan and Social Security benefits would remain the same, the Employee Benefit Research Institute simulated final payouts for segmented incomes and found 86\\xc2\\xa0percent of low-income earners would get at least 60 percent of their pay in retirement at age 64. The three higher groups of wage earners would see similar bottom-line results.\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI think that\\xe2\\x80\\x99s pretty good,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Jack VanDerhei, the EBRI\\xe2\\x80\\x99s research director. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cThe analysis shows that even without a traditional [defined benefit] plan, a very large percentage of employees who are fortunate enough to work for 401(k) sponsors for most of their careers should be able to replace what many financial advisers consider to be a sufficient percentage of their pre-retirement income when combined with Social Security.\\xe2\\x80\\x9dMeanwhile, Fidelity Investments recently created its Retirement Preparedness Measure, a tool that gauges whether workers are saving enough today to cover retirement expenses tomorrow. Fidelity surveyed 2,200 households and ran through planning models to see where Americans stood. Overall, despite a rebounding economy, 55 percent of people with 401(k) plans are in fair or poor condition, and 45 percent are in very good or good shape.Red ZoneFidelity results show millennials are in the red zone, estimating that this group, born between 1978 and 1988, according to the study, would be able to cover just 62 percent of retirement expenses, under their current savings and spending rates.Gen Xers, born between 1965 and 1977 fare better, covering 71 percent of retirement expenses. Baby boomers, those born between 1946 and 1964, are in good shape, and will be able to cover 81 percent of senior expenses.John Sweeney, executive vice president of retirement and investment strategies at Fidelity says a large part of the problem is that America saves too little. Survey results showed 40 percent of respondents are saving less than 6\\xc2\\xa0percent of their salaries today. Sweeney added that only about 10 percent are contributing to the Internal Revenue Service\\xe2\\x80\\x99s contribution ceiling, which is $17,500 for 2014.\\xe2\\x80\\x9cWe want people to establish a lifestyle that incorporates savings,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Sweeney said. Action from all age groups \\xe2\\x80\\x9cneeds to be taken.\\xe2\\x80\\x9dAnother drain on retirement savings is loans. Today, about 24 percent of 401(k) participants have taken a loan or cashed out early from their account, according to Purchasing Power, an employee purchase plan provider based in Atlanta. Nearly 40 percent of the loans go to general household expenses.\\xe2\\x80\\x9cIf someone gets in the habit of borrowing from their 401(k), it isn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t going to be an effective tool to help them save for retirement,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Elizabeth Halkos, chief marketing officer for Purchasing Power.Installing an employee purchase plan steers workers away from snatching dollars that need to grow in 401(k) accounts. Workers are able to create payment plans to cover household items or other needs.\\xc2\\xa0 \\xe2\\x80\\x9cWe see ourselves as the alternative to the 401(k) loan,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Halkos said.Plan sponsors are the final decision-makers of 401(k) design. Over the years, plan sponsors have evolved their thinking as to what makes a successful plan. Things like participation rates, diversified investments or well-educated workers used to be top factors.Today, outcomes or results are the buzzwords. For the first time, 18 percent of employers considered plans successful when they generate enough retirement income for participants, an October 2013 Aon Hewitt survey showed. The question has become: How do plan sponsors design a 401(k) so its workers participate, contribute as much as possible, increase that contribution and invest appropriately so, in the end, they can have a comfortable retirement?\\xe2\\x80\\x9cIncreasingly, it is the plan sponsor who is driving how people save,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Lori Lucas, executive vice president and defined contribution practice leader at Callan Associates.Lucas said changes in thinking began in 2012 after the U.S. Labor Department required plan sponsors to get fee information from providers and to report certain costs to participants using 401(k) plans. This move caused lots of plan sponsors to look deep into their 401(k) design and figure out whether its components were worth the costs.As a result, plan sponsors did their homework in 2012, reviewing investment policy statements, evaluating, and sometimes replacing managers and their investments, according to Callan\\xe2\\x80\\x99s 2014 Defined Contribution Trends Survey.The survey showed that, in 2012, 84 percent of plan sponsors made sure they were in step with the new regulations, 63 percent reviewed investment policy statement and 41 percent replaced managers or funds.In 2013, the Labor Department stepped in again. It issued tips on how to select a target-date fund, a highly popular investment for automatically enrolling workers into 401(k) plans. Armed with better plan design knowledge and the tips, many plan sponsors moved from using a target-date fund from their record-keeper\\xe2\\x80\\x99s offerings to one that better suited the plan and its participants.Callan\\xe2\\x80\\x99s survey showed only 46 percent of plan sponsors used their record-keeper\\xe2\\x80\\x99s target-date fund last year compared with 59 percent in 2012. Plus, about a third of respondents say they plan to make a change to this investment in 2014.\\xe2\\x80\\x9cIt has definitely been an evolution with target-date funds,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Lucas said. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cThere are more sophisticated tools today from even a few years ago.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Going with a target-date fund will be directly related to how much participants will be able to save for retirement, she added.Auto ToolsAutomatic tools are also on the rise, which will help more workers get into plans. Callan\\xe2\\x80\\x99s research shows the practice of automatically enrolling participants in defined contribution plans has almost doubled to 58 percent in 2013 from 32 percent in 2006.But dovetailing this feature with automatic increases to workers\\xe2\\x80\\x99 contributions still seems to be stuck, experts say. For the past two years, only 43 percent of companies that have automatic enrollment combine it with automatic contribution increases, Callan\\xe2\\x80\\x99s study showed.That can mean trouble for many workers because federal law says plan sponsors can automatically enroll workers using 3 percent of their pay to open accounts. Many studies have shown that most workers that enter the system at that rate stay there unless someone comes in and increases it for them. Even with a matching contribution from the employer, workers won\\xe2\\x80\\x99t save to the magic 15 percent of pay most industry experts say is necessary to retire comfortably.A third of plan sponsors to J.P. Morgan\\xe2\\x80\\x99s 2013 Defined Contribution Plan Sponsor survey said they are in that holding pattern because they think employees don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t want an automatic increase in contributions each year. That isn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t surprising considering 80 percent said they consider employee satisfaction a critical factor in determining a successful plan.Many plan sponsors have it wrong because J.P. Morgan\\xe2\\x80\\x99s survey also talked to participants. Sixty percent said they were either neutral or OK with employers bumping the pretax salary payment to their retirement accounts.\\xe2\\x80\\x9cIt always goes back to the concern of the participants\\xe2\\x80\\x99 reactions,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d J.P. Morgan\\xe2\\x80\\x99s Peterson said. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cEmployers don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t want to get complaints from employees.\\xe2\\x80\\x9dAnother way employers are trying to improve worker retirement savings results is through re-enrollment. Today, employers are taking a harder look at where employees are investing their 401(k) assets. Through re-enrollment, plan sponsors tell participants that they plan to override their investment decisions (unless told not to), and then typically re-enroll workers into an age-appropriate target-date fund.\\xe2\\x80\\x9cRe-enrollment has become more of a best practice, as opposed to the anomaly it was a few years ago,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said J.P. Morgan\\xe2\\x80\\x99s Peterson.Patty Kujawa is a writer based in Milwaukee. Comment below or email\\xc2\\xa0editors@workforce.com.

       " ['SubscribeBack IssuesContributeAdvertisebyCary DonhamWhat should you do when you have to fill a key position with the right person for the job and had to do it by yesterday? First, take a deep breath, count to 10, and consider these tips to avoid recruiting and hiring traps:\\xc2\\xb7\\xc2\\xa0\\xc2\\xa0\\xc2\\xa0\\xc2\\xa0\\xc2\\xa0 Know which laws apply. Of course, you know about the federal anti-discrimination laws implicated in recruiting and hiring: Title VII of the Civil Rights Act, the Age Discrimination in Employment Act, the Americans with Disabilities Act and the Equal Pay Act, the last of which prohibits wage discrimination between men and women holding substantially equal jobs. But you should also keep in mind the more recent Genetic Information Nondiscrimination Act of 2008, which prohibits discrimination based on genetic information and the Uniformed Services Employment and Reemployment Rights Act, which prohibits discrimination based on military service or obligation as well as state and local laws that prohibit discrimination because of mental status or sexual preference. Also, consider whether the position to be filled is an administrative, executive or professional position that is exempt from overtime rules.\\xc2\\xb7\\xc2\\xa0\\xc2\\xa0\\xc2\\xa0\\xc2\\xa0\\xc2\\xa0 Ensure that your recruiting methods comply with these laws. With those federal, state, and local laws in mind, you\\xe2\\x80\\x99re ready to navigate the minefield and begin finding the right new employee. The first step in any recruitment is advertising. Employers should avoid word-of-mouth recruiting or publications that are tailored to specific groups, which can inadvertently narrow the applicant pool and exclude minorities or women. Instead, employers should advertise broadly, including, but not limited to internal and external notice boards, a variety of outside publications, a recruitment agency and the Internet.\\xc2\\xa0\\xc2\\xb7\\xc2\\xa0\\xc2\\xa0\\xc2\\xa0\\xc2\\xa0\\xc2\\xa0 Beware of pre-employment tests and research. Does the position require pre-employment testing? If so, you should closely review the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission\\xe2\\x80\\x99s guidance on this topic, as testing can be a fertile ground for lawsuits. Any written or physical pre-employment test used in hiring must be necessary and related to the job, and shouldn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t exclude a disproportionate part of a particular protected group. In addition, research indicates that between a third and a half of human resources managers use the Internet for background checks on candidates. However, what seems to be public information on LinkedIn or Facebook can be problematic, since you might learn an applicant\\xe2\\x80\\x99s age, religion, marital status or other information you would not ask for in an interview. Also, are you certain you located the right person? Consider carefully whether information you might obtain through the Internet will be accurate or is worth the risk of potential legal action.\\xc2\\xb7\\xc2\\xa0\\xc2\\xa0\\xc2\\xa0\\xc2\\xa0\\xc2\\xa0 Ensure interviews are objective and job-related. Now that you\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve narrowed the field, you are ready for the interviews. You should make sure that you have a clear selection criterion, have more than one interviewer for each applicant to promote fairness, and ask applicants only similar job-related questions. Of course, avoid questions regarding marital or family status, or any other personal topics or subjects unrelated to the applicant\\xe2\\x80\\x99s qualifications for the position. You should also keep in mind that any notes you take during the interview, including your Internet research or comments on a r\\xc3\\xa9sum\\xc3\\xa9, should be related to the applicant\\xe2\\x80\\x99s qualifications and should not document anything that could be considered discriminatory or disparaging.\\xc2\\xa0\\xc2\\xa0\\xc2\\xa0\\xc2\\xb7\\xc2\\xa0\\xc2\\xa0\\xc2\\xa0\\xc2\\xa0\\xc2\\xa0 Determine if your organization is required to have an affirmative action plan. \\xc2\\xa0Finally, if your company routinely receives work from the federal government, an affirmative action plan may be required for entering into a federal contract. For example, service and supply contractors with 50 or more employees and government contracts of $50,000 or more are required to develop and implement a written affirmative action program for each establishment where they can also set the goals. If this applies to your company, you should familiarize yourself with the requirements.Heather A. Jackson and Cary E.

       " ['SubscribeBack IssuesContributeAdvertisebyGarry KranzPhoto courtesy of ThinkstockDuring his stint as chief operating officer at software company Tackk, Robert Hatta knew he needed some help to recruit top-flight computer programmers.Tackk focused on developers with applied knowledge of C++, encrypted PHP and HTML \\xe2\\x80\\x94 advanced computing languages Tackk uses in its own software, which enables users to create and post multimedia content and share it across social networking sites.To help, Hatta decided to use Gild Source, a talent management suite marketed by Gild Inc. of San Francisco. The Gild Source algorithm crawls online user forums frequented by software designers, such as GitHub.com and Stackoverflow.com, and aggregates information about each individual.Rather than simply generating a list of names, Gild Source provided examples of each developer\\xe2\\x80\\x99s programming and collaboration on software projects. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cThat enabled me to contextualize our outreach in a way that was much more relevant,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d says Hatta, who joined investment firm Drive Capital earlier this year as a partner, but still works as an adviser to Tackk.Gild software aims to eliminate subjectivity and guesswork for recruiters, who are frequently overwhelmed with information overload, said CEO Sheeroy Desai. Gild Source is used by nearly one-quarter of Fortune 500 companies, with annual software licenses costing $8,400.\\xe2\\x80\\x9cOur database contains profiles on 6.5 million software developers. Analyzing that many candidates to find the right applicant would take a very long time,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Desai said. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cWe\\xe2\\x80\\x99re doing this on massive scale, looking at information and enabling recruiters to see information at a granular level.\\xe2\\x80\\x9dSoftware developers with a proven track record will continue to be in high demand, according to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics. It forecasts employment of software developers will grow 30 percent to nearly 1.2 million jobs by 2020, fueled by the ubiquity of mobile applications.Meanwhile, the global market for recruiting software generated revenue of $1.2 billion in 2012, according to International Data Corp., a research firm based in Framingham, Massachusetts.Gild and competitors Entelo and TalentBin are among a new breed of HR recruiting software: algorithm-driven tools that aim to help talent managers scour the Internet and separate the wheat from the chaff. The software searches online forums, Twitter feeds and other publicly available sources to identify potential candidates.The software gives hiring managers a new way to find passive candidates, said Lisa Rowan, an IDC vice president. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cThe tools use a set of algorithms to sweep the entire Web to find potential candidates whose talents and skills are not easily replicated,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d including writing and posting open-source code that gets picked up and used by other developers.\\xe2\\x80\\x9cYou don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t even have to see the code. The algorithm will tell you how good the candidates are,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Rowan said.Gild Source\\xe2\\x80\\x99s recruiting algorithm finds sites frequented by programmers and identifies people using their email address or a common avatar or nickname used across multiple sites. The information is exported into an indexed database of user profiles, with each programmer ranked with a numerical score to indicate quality, frequency and coding prowess.The profiles provide a glimpse into a developer\\xe2\\x80\\x99s body of code-writing work, including any projects into which the code has been integrated by other developers. The frequency of participation and quality of feedback from other users also is used to rank each developer, enabling recruiters to isolate those with discrete skills or knowledge.San Francisco-based Entelo, which launched in 2012, takes the approach a step further, CEO Jon Bischke said. Like Gild, Entelo\\xe2\\x80\\x99s suite crawls commonly visited developer forums, but it also zeroes in on candidates who are most susceptible to a recruiting pitch.Entelo charges $12,000 a year for its software, which includes two full product licenses.\\xe2\\x80\\x9cWe look at all kinds of data to determine the likelihood that a person is willing to change jobs,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Bischke, whose company has signed up more than 80 corporate clients. In addition to software developers, the Entelo search engine can help find potential recruits in other white-collar professions, including engineers and graphic designers.TalentBin, another San Francisco vendor, launched its product in 2012 to mirror LinkedIn\\xe2\\x80\\x99s Recruiter, a sourcing tool aimed at hiring managers. TalentBin\\xe2\\x80\\x99s annual license costs $6,000.CEO Peter Kazanjy, who estimates his company\\xe2\\x80\\x99s database includes more than 100 million candidates, said the idea is to help recruiters sift through \\xe2\\x80\\x9cimplicit data sources\\xe2\\x80\\x9d on the Web, including Twitter posts, online collaborations and user forums.TalentBin even scrolls the U.S. patent database to find creative people with inventive ideas, Kazanjy said. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cWe consume data from all across the professional Web, extract it and structure it into a composite user profile.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\xc2\\xa0Garry Kranz is a Workforce contributing editor.

In the research, attractive women got callbacks 54 percent of the time and attractive men 47 percent of the time. The average callback rate in the study was 30 percent. For people considered \\xe2\\x80\\x9cunattractive,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d the callback rate was a repulsive 7 percent for women and 26 percent for men, respectively.That\\xe2\\x80\\x99s some ugly data for sure, but there\\xe2\\x80\\x99s more to look at than the beauty discussion when it comes to appearance.

       " ['SubscribeBack IssuesContributeAdvertisebySite StaffThough usage across all age groups for Roth 401(k)s is growing slowly, a new study reveals that more employers are offering it as a retirement option, and younger workers are eager to sign up.In the first quarter of 2013, nearly 17 percent of workers under age 30 are picking a Roth 401(k) defined contribution plan when employers offer it, up from about 15 percent last year, according to a study by Wells Fargo Institutional Retirement and Trust.\\xe2\\x80\\x9cWe see this as a significant trend that it keeps increasing,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d says Laurie Nordquist, director of Wells Fargo Institutional Retirement and Trust. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cIt\\xe2\\x80\\x99s not nearly that big of a tax bill if you are under 30.\\xe2\\x80\\x9dOverall, 10 percent of the 2 million participants in a select group of defined contribution plans managed by Wells Fargo are choosing to invest through a Roth 401(k) this year, up from 8.9 percent in 2012. Also, 27 percent of employers in the Wells Fargo study now offer the Roth plan, up 5.3 percent from last year.The big difference between a traditional 401(k) and a Roth 401(k) is taxes. In a traditional plan, participants don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t pay taxes on money they put in, and on investment earnings. Participants pay federal and state income at the tax rate they are at when withdrawing money in retirement.For Roth 401(k) participants, it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s nearly the opposite. Participants pay taxes at their taxable income rate when they contribute to the plan. Money grows tax free, and as long as they are at least age 59\\xc2\\xbd, withdrawals from the account are tax free.Nordquist agrees movement is slow, but it is significant that younger workers are seeing the advantage of Roth 401(k) for two reasons. First, because they are just starting their careers, they are more likely to pay lower retirement taxes now and not have to pay a higher rate when they are at the end of their career, withdrawing at a higher tax bracket. Second, they are making a conscious decision to move into a Roth, since no Wells Fargo participant is automatically enrolled in a Roth plan. If automatic enrollment is used, participants are put into a traditional plan.\\xe2\\x80\\x9cYounger workers really understand that if they can pay taxes now, it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s a really nice opportunity for those with a long runway to retirement,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Nordquist says. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cThis reflects that people are a little more engaged in the tax element. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s an important part of saving for retirement.\\xe2\\x80\\x9dThe American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012 made it possible for participants to convert all the money in their traditional plan to a Roth, if the plan is offered by the employer. But Vanguard\\xe2\\x80\\x99s report, How America Saves 2013, shows that even though half of employers in the study offer Roth plans, only 4 percent are offering conversions to participants. Of that 4 percent, only a third of participants are taking advantage of the offering.As employers wait for clearer instructions from the federal government on how to allow conversions, it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s hard for many participants to come up with the tax cash upfront anyway, says Jean Young, senior research analyst at the Vanguard Center for Retirement Research. But, as a means to hedge against what might happen with the tax system in the future, participants should consider holding retirement dollars in traditional and Roth 401(k) plans.\\xe2\\x80\\x9cWe have a highly complex tax system,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Young says. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cFor participants, having to write that [tax] check today, it can be tough.\\xe2\\x80\\x9dPatty Kujawa is a writer based in Milwaukee.

       " ['SubscribeBack IssuesContributeAdvertisebyJennifer BenzLike many of you reading this article, I stumbled into HR as a career.As a journalism student who had never heard of employee benefits or HR or consulting, I was drawn to benefits because of the complexity and challenge of making sense of such meaty topics. But I soon discovered a much deeper sense of purpose in this work \\xe2\\x80\\x94 and that purpose has kept me both in benefits and incredibly passionate about this industry.Here\\xe2\\x80\\x99s why: Employee benefits touch the health and financial security of nearly all Americans and millions of people around the world.Working in benefits is one of the few careers in which you can know you\\xe2\\x80\\x99re making a difference in what\\xe2\\x80\\x99s really important to people \\xe2\\x80\\x94 almost all the time. Whether you\\xe2\\x80\\x99re working as a provider, a consultant or in an employer HR department, you\\xe2\\x80\\x99re having an impact on a lot of lives. You\\xe2\\x80\\x99re doing work that matters. The same can be said about so many other important areas of HR \\xe2\\x80\\x94 training, learning and development, organizational development, to name just a few.But how many people outside our industry know that? Does anyone grow up wanting to be an HR pro?I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve been thinking about this since my company, Benz Communications, concluded our interview series of 27 benefits pros as part of celebrating our 10th anniversary last year. (You can read all the interviews on LinkedIn.) They are an inspiring group of benefits leaders at large employers and benefits providers.When we asked, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cHow did you get into employee benefits,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d nearly everyone we spoke with confessed they stumbled into their career in benefits, and then fell in love with the space \\xe2\\x80\\x94 much like I did. Without exception, what struck us was the absolute passion and the sense of pride and purpose these benefits leaders have about their careers.Sarah Lecuna said she \\xe2\\x80\\x9cfell into\\xe2\\x80\\x9d benefits. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI wanted to be in the HR function, but wasn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t sure where would be the best fit for me and I the best fit for it. When I got a job in benefits I thought it would be temporary, but I love the work, the ever-changing landscape, and the impact it has on people\\xe2\\x80\\x99s lives.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Now she\\xe2\\x80\\x99s the global benefits leader at Intuit Inc. And Lecuna was named one of Workforce\\xe2\\x80\\x99s Game Changers in 2014.Allison Wendelberger also didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t get into benefits by design.\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI was finishing grad school and didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t have a clear path in mind. Since I was a math major, I decided to take a couple of actuarial exams to make my r\\xc3\\xa9sum\\xc3\\xa9 more enticing,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d she recalled. She landed at HR consultancy Mercer and then spent 15 years with Aflac until she moved to her current role as business development manager for ITA Group.\\xe2\\x80\\x9cEssentially, we create programs that motivate behavior change in all the people who matter to an organization,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d she explained.Virgin Pulse President and CMO Rajiv Kumar started out as a doctor, but said, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cWorking in employee benefits allows me to positively impact the greatest number of lives. In clinical practice, I\\xe2\\x80\\x99d only be able to see a finite number of patients each day. Virgin Pulse, on the other hand, has touched more than 5 million lives around the world. The potential is inspiring.\\xe2\\x80\\x9dInspiring, it is. The scope of all we touch in benefits is huge, which most people don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t realize.\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI love the fact that we make an impact at both an individual level as well as a social level. In benefits, I have a view of the difference we make not only in our employees\\xe2\\x80\\x99 lives, but also in our company culture, communities and even legislation. I find it extremely gratifying,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Rosemary Arriada-Keiper, senior director of global benefits at Adobe.Most people want careers that give them a sense of purpose. They want to do work that has meaning and value in the world. Employee benefits are ideal in that sense. But how do we make it less happenstance for great young people to get into the industry?Clearly, our profession isn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t exactly front and center when children are aspiring to what they want to be when they grow up. There\\xe2\\x80\\x99s no Benefits Adviser Barbie or HR Director Lego set for our career.But, we can all play a role in making HR a more desirable \\xe2\\x80\\x94 and earlier \\xe2\\x80\\x94 career aspiration. Accepting external speaking opportunities, sharing our stories and talking in the press about the great work our companies do is a start. Finding ways to brag about your career at your kids\\xe2\\x80\\x99 school or a college career fair can\\xe2\\x80\\x99t hurt, either.All of those efforts can help inspire the next generation of game changers.Jennifer Benz is CEO and founder of Benz Communications, a San Francisco-based employee benefits communications agency.

       " ['SubscribeBack IssuesContributeAdvertisebySarah Fister GaleIn today\\xe2\\x80\\x99s on-demand world, employees want training at the moment they need it, and they want it to align with their learning style and knowledge. That\\xe2\\x80\\x99s driving many learning technology vendors and content providers to build analytics tools that can match learning content to the needs of employees.Social media platforms are helping employees personalize the learning experience by giving them access to experts and shared knowledge.\\xe2\\x80\\x9cIt\\xe2\\x80\\x99s still early stages, but analytics in training is not a fad,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Elissa Tucker, principal research lead for APQC in Milwaukee.She\\xe2\\x80\\x99s seen several companies investing in tools like knowledge maps that overlay individual\\xe2\\x80\\x99s skillsets with the learning needs required for a role, then using machine learning algorithms to recommend or assign courses based on those models to close skill gaps.\\xe2\\x80\\x9cCutting-edge learning organizations with a lot of resources are at the forefront of this trend,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d she said. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cBut others will soon follow.\\xe2\\x80\\x9dSome content providers are also beginning to implement analytics and machine learning technology to make their content more relevant and efficient for customers. PeopleSEC, for example, uses analytics to identify which employees need training based on their response to phishing emails. Those who follow security protocols don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t need to take additional classes, while those who click on phishing links generated by the software are automatically signed up.Analytics tools can also customize the type of training suggested, based on a learner\\xe2\\x80\\x99s previous course selections, preferred format or access capabilities. Where one employee might prefer a classroom course or MOOC, another might prefer mobile-enabled self-paced learning, Tucker said. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cIt is giving organizations a way to make learning more personalized.\\xe2\\x80\\x9dLittle Bits of LearningSocial media platforms are also helping employees personalize the learning experience by giving them access to experts and shared knowledge, and letting them share and rate content. They can also find content from external sources, like YouTube and Lynda.com, and share that knowledge with their peers.Social learning is a powerful trend in the learning space, said Barry Stern, senior vice president of Development Dimensions International\\xe2\\x80\\x99s accelerated development solutions in Pittsburgh.\\xe2\\x80\\x9cCompanies want to unleash the vitality of their peer-to-peer community,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he said. Social platforms give them this capability.However, learning leaders need to pay attention to the quality of these engagements. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cWhat people like and what they need is different,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he said, noting that just because a video gets 200 upvotes doesn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t mean it adds value as a learning tool.This trend has become important as employees seek a more diverse collection of learning opportunities, and prefer lots of small bites of training rather than one big multihour course, said Bill Pelster, principal with Deloitte Consulting in Seattle.\\xe2\\x80\\x9cThe microlearning trend is going mainstream,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he said. While 15-minute chunks of learning may not deliver an entire skill set, they are valuable tools for busy employees who use them to solve problems at the point of need. But tracking this knowledge acquisition is tricky, Pelster said. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cCompanies need tools that help them certify the learning is taking place.\\xe2\\x80\\x9dThe challenge for vendors is providing companies with technology to manage all of this curated content from all of its many sources, agreed Stern. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cThere is no clear answer, but it is definitely on their minds.\\xe2\\x80\\x9dSome learning management systems vendors, like Saba Software, Totara Learning Solutions and Cornerstone OnDemand are adding tools to help manage more types of content, rate their relevance and track who is using them as a way to rein in this trend. Several niche software companies have also emerged, including Degreed and Pathgather, which help companies and employees find, share and track learning from multiple sources.\\xe2\\x80\\x9cThere is a world of content out there that is available to learners,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Pelster said. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cOrganizations need visibility into how this content is being used.\\xe2\\x80\\x9dAs millennials and Generation Z employees take over the workplace, and the need for new skill development constantly evolves, these microlearning curated-content trends will only continue. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cAnything that facilitates employees sharing knowledge, collaborating and connecting to learning will add value,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Tucker said. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cAnd the vendors who provide these options will resonate with their customers.\\xe2\\x80\\x9dSarah Fister Gale is a writer living in Chicago.

       "      <th>SubscribeBack IssuesContributeAdvertisebyKris DunnIf you follow the recruiting space, you likely would agree that three trends have dominated the recruitment marketing landscape in the past five to 10 years.LinkedIn has become the candidate database of choice for recruiters, Glassdoor has forced HR and recruiting leaders to acknowledge the importance of company reputation via aggregation of anonymous ratings, and Indeed has parlayed the power of jobs SEO/search into a dominant business model.But the more things change, the more they stay the same. Those market positions/origins converge as each of those recruitment-marketing vendors has sought to monetize their business model.Translation: LinkedIn, Glassdoor and Indeed all sell job postings as a primary driver of revenue. Some have found that embedding job postings in bundled offerings is the only way to fully monetize the features that made them famous (LinkedIn, Glassdoor), and one has fully redefined what a job posting is by owning candidate search and making you pay for preferred placement to access candidate attention (Indeed).But each of the business models is reliant on and subject to one important behavioral trend: Candidates aren�۪t using job boards as a starting point for job search, they�۪re just typing the name of a company in a web browser (or conducting a search like ���jobs in 30328�۝), and away they go.That reality built Indeed into the powerhouse it is today. But there�۪s a new sheriff in town ��� Google for Jobs.Google for Jobs can be described as a new search results feature when you use Google for search.�� The feature is simple: For searches with ���clear intent�۝ (e.g., ���head of HR jobs in Chicago�۝ or ���entry-level jobs in Boise�۝), Google shows a formatted preview of job listings scraped from various sources under a generic tag, ���jobs.�۝Google for Jobs currently includes job postings from sources like LinkedIn, CareerBuilder and Glassdoor, but also job postings hosted on a company�۪s own website ��� if the bots like the formatting of your careers site.Google for Jobs doesn�۪t include listings for Indeed. And that should make you blink as an HR/talent/recruiting leader.The Google for Jobs search results serve to push organic listings at your company on Indeed, Glassdoor and other providers to what is known as ���below the fold�۝ status on their screen. That means candidates must scroll to find some of the results from the providers you currently pay to drive traffic to your jobs. That�۪s potentially a big problem.What�۪s an HR/recruiting leader to do? Here�۪s my advice to avoid waking up one day and finding the recruitment marketing world has passed you by in the Google for Jobs era:The naysayers will tell you Google�۪s had a lot of failed experiments ��� Google Wave and Google Plus among them ��� and they�۪re right.Candidate behavior toward job search suggests that those expecting Google for Jobs to have zero impact are misguided at best. Keep your eye on the performance of postings you currently pay for and adjust accordingly for best results.Kris Dunn, the chief human resources officer at Kinetix, is a��Workforce��contributing editor.

       "      <th>SubscribeBack IssuesContributeAdvertisebyJon HymanI�۪ve never written about the time I stripped naked in front of my entire law school ��_ until now.Well, here we go.It was 1997 and I was a 3L at Case Western Reserve School of Law, biding my time until graduation and the bar exam.Looking for ways to spice up my final year of schooling, I volunteered to co-auctioneer the school�۪s annual fundraiser for its public interest law foundation.The event started at 6 pm. We tapped the keg around 4.Needless to say, I was several sheets to the wind before I gaveled my first item.Based on the relative popularity of certain faculty members, I thought I knew which donated items would raise the most money.One particular item that was expected to raise big dollars was being slow-bid. In my infinite wisdom (or drunken haze, my memory can�۪t quite decipher which), I decided that my fellow law students needed an enticement to quicken the bidding pace.���When this item hits $500, I�۪ll pull my pants down,�۝ I exclaimed!The plan was to drop my blue jeans, but leave the naughtiest bits safely behind the cover of my Gap boxers.Ah, the best laid plans. I had not accounted for the impact alcohol would have on my intended-to-be dexterous waste-band swipe.In my stuporous haste, I not only grabbed the waste of my jeans, but also that of the Gap boxers on whose hopes I had staked my modesty.Damn.So there I was, Jon and his ���friends,�۝ for all to see (at least for the quick moment before I hoisted my britches).Here�۪s the employment lesson. (I can�۪t tell this story without bringing it 360 to an employment lesson.)I can guarantee that every candidate you consider for employment has at least one moment like this in their background. And, because of the prevalence of the iPhone (generically standing in for all smartphones) and the Facebook (generically standing in for all social media), many of those candidates will not be able to hide from these embarrassments.Your job as an employer is to determine which embarrassments are blips in the history of your future employee and which are red flags that scream ���Do Not Hire.�۝Thank god in 1997 there was no thing as iPhone or Facebook. But, even if there was, my Full-Monty moment would have in no way predicted my success as a lawyer. I haven�۪t had my clothes off in public since.So, use the internet to hire, but do not automatically assume that what you see is the be-all and end-all of every candidate. It is but one piece of the hiring puzzle, and, sometimes, it is in no way dispositive of the polished product you will hire.Jon Hyman is a partner at Meyers, Roman, Friedberg &amp; Lewis in Cleveland.

       "      <th>SubscribeBack IssuesContributeAdvertisebySarah Fister GaleBig-name companies such as McDonald�۪s and Goldman Sachs have tested using Snapchat to recruit millennials.In April, McDonald�۪s Corp. showed surprising social media edge when it took its recruiting campaign to Snapchat, the mobile app that lets users exchange videos and images that self-destruct after a few seconds. The initial campaign began in Australia, where they encouraged candidates to use a Snapchat filter to try on virtual uniforms, then upload their own 10-second pitch in lieu of filling out a job application.In June, McDonald�۪s launched the campaign in the United States on a simpler scale. Instead of uploading videos, potential candidates could watch current employees talking for 10 seconds about how much they love their jobs, and they can swipe to see local job openings at the company�۪s career page.Even without the uniform filter and video application, it was a fun use of a social media platform that hasn�۪t gotten much attention from the recruiting world, said Ray Wang of Constellation Research Inc. It also makes a lot of sense for a company like McDonald�۪s. ���They want to hire the 16- to 24-year-old demographic that uses Snapchat,�۝ he said. ���It is a great way to reach them.�۝Whether this is the start of a new recruiting trend or just a gimmick remains to be seen. McDonald�۪s had a lot of things going for it to make this campaign a hit, said Jody Ordioni, president and chief branding officer for Brandemix, a��brand marketing agency.��It�۪s already a huge brand that is popular among the very people they are trying to hire ��� millennials and Generation Z. And because it was a novel recruiting strategy, it was buzzworthy. ���McDonald�۪s generated a lot of momentum by being first,�۝ she said.McDonald�۪s isn�۪t the only big company that has tried to figure out whether Snapchat is a viable recruiting tool and how to use it. In fact, they weren�۪t even the first.In 2016, Cisco took to Snapchat with its #WeAreCisco social media campaign, encouraging brand ambassadors from across the company to post content about life at Cisco directly to the channel ��� without any reviews or attempts to edit. Cisco�۪s Talent Brand Team knew that the only way it would work was if the content was authentic, according to Social Media Manager Carmen Shirkey Collins. ���We didn�۪t want to be ���marketers,�۪ we wanted to be ���co-workers,�۪ �۝ she wrote in a blog about the project. The employees loved the idea, and not only created content for Snapchat but promoted it on their own social networks via other platforms. Collins reported a 600 percent follower increase week��over week in the first three months of launching.Possibly the most surprising early adopter was financial giant Goldman Sachs, which ran its own recruiting campaign on Snapchat�۪s Campus Story platform in 2015 with a series of 10-second recruitment videos seeking ���campus environmental leaders,�۝ ���youth sports coaches�۝ and ���crowd-funding champions.�۝ The snaps were only accessible to people in and around 60 targeted campuses and was part of the financial firm�۪s broader efforts to appeal to a younger, hipper candidate pool. The nine-day campaign accrued more than 2.1 million views and the company reported a significant increase in traffic to the Careers webpage.None of these companies released data around whether the campaigns actually translated into new hires, and because snaps only exist for a short time, users can�۪t go looking for these ads or use them to drive long-term results.That�۪s part of the problem, said Wang. ���If you can�۪t generate viral activity around the campaign, it won�۪t work.�۝The Novelty FactorSnapchat presents many obstacles that make it tricky as a recruiting tool. Potential candidates have to already follow the brand to see the snaps, and they need to respond in real time for it to have an effect. And while using filters and videos can be a fun way to engage candidates, companies need to decide if they can judge someone by a 10-second video, or whether they can deliver a powerful enough recruiting message in that time to drive career-age traffic.That�۪s not to say Snapchat can�۪t be useful for recruiting if it�۪s used as part of the broader social media engagement effort and not a strategy unto itself. ���You can�۪t rely on any single social media outlet to drive brand awareness,�۝ Ordioni said. ���It�۪s just one piece of the process.�۝For companies interested in expanding their social reach via Snapchat, Ordioni suggests campaigns be linked to a broader recruiting effort or event and designed to engage the largely younger demographic with genuine stories that will grab their attention.It also can�۪t be a one-off effort. As with any social media platform, followers expect a steady stream of original content ��� not just the occasional self-promotional post ��� so companies shouldn�۪t focus on Snapchat unless they have the bandwidth to generate that kind of continuous content, she said. ���If you ask people to follow you on Snapchat, it has to be a long-term commitment.�۝Sarah Fister Gale is a writer in Chicago.

       "      <th>SubscribeBack IssuesContributeAdvertisebySimon RakosiLogging extra hours or being on call during evenings and weekends does not guarantee results. It can lead to burnout and diminished productivity.Barstool Sports CEO Erika Nardini became a victim of public scrutiny in August after telling the New York Times��about a test she uses to measure a candidate�۪s commitment during the hiring process. Her system involves texting at an odd hour of the weekend to see how quickly the candidate will respond.Not surprisingly, the internet jumped on the soundbite. In vein with the premise of Jon Ronson�۪s ���So You�۪ve Been Publicly Shamed,�۝ the executive is being tied to a single comment in a rather extreme fashion. Regardless of your take on Nardini�۪s vetting process, I�۪d argue that the conversation that has resulted is a net-positive for those of us in the business of building teams and companies.I must admit: The concept of ���overwork�۝ is a bit foreign to me. I grew up in Belgium, where society takes a much different approach to work-life balance. Last year, for example, France passed legislation making the case that employers cannot penalize their employees for failing to respond to emails during non-working hours. These types of policies are designed to protect workers against conditions that serve to threaten their well-being.On this very subject, Vox recently published an opinion piece that makes the case that today�۪s employers are like ���dictators,�۝ creating societies within the workplaces in which regulations (or ���laws�۝) are placed on employee-citizens that are designed to subjugate them to ���tyrannical�۝ conditions. Of course, the counter to this argument ��� and to Nardini�۪s policy at Barstool ��� is that employees choose to work at private companies at-will, and if the systems aren�۪t a fit for their lifestyles, they can always leave.From a business owner�۪s perspective, I would argue that policies and ���tests�۝ that promote over-work are counterproductive in the long term. Squeezing out productivity from employees during off-hours or cutting into their personal time might serve a short-term purpose, but in the long term these cultures are harder to sustain and make it difficult to attract and maintain top talent. Here�۪s why.Work-Life Balance Correlates to Overall HappinessEarlier this year, my company ran a study based on data compiled from a sample of 5,000 Butterfly users (employees) in the United States, Europe, the Middle East and Asia. Our aim was to understand the correlation between key drivers of engagement in the workplace ��� like team dynamics, leadership and work-life balance ��� and overall happiness. Our results showed that work-life balance had the strongest correlation with employee happiness, ranking above things like office environment (I.e., ���work perks�۝) and even managers.Companies have been using tactics like free beer and company merchandise to recruit millennials, but our study and other observations (like those made in Dan Lyons�۪ book, ���Disrupted: My Misadventure in the Startup Bubble�۝) suggest that superficial perks aren�۪t what�۪s keeping young talent happy and productive at work. Instead, millennials are looking for balanced lifestyles promoted by strong managers who care about their well-being and professional development.The notion of servant leadership was birthed by Robert K. Greenleaf in 1970. His philosophy was that the strongest leaders are those that live to support and serve the needs of their teams. Managers with a ���servant-first�۝ mindset, therefore, are compelled to make sure that their employee�۪s highest priority needs are being met first ��� in other words, it�۪s about being there for your employee at 9 p.m. on a Sunday and not the other way around.As a co-founder of a company that has grown from three co-founders to more than 15 employees in less than two years, I can�۪t help but scratch my head at the idea of expecting my people to be there for me during odd hours. In my mind, it�۪s about letting my team know that I will be there for them, regardless of the time of day or reason for their outreach.In fact, this idea that managers should be sourcing feedback from their teams on an ongoing basis is the founding principle of the employee intelligence startup I co-founded with my colleagues David Mendlewicz and Marcus Perezi-Tormos.Value Achievement Over ActivitySetting aside the cultural implications of expecting employees to sacrifice work/life balance for the ���cause,�۝ this philosophy also misses the mark when it comes to what truly makes great businesses survive and thrive. As a basketball player, I�۪ll reference Hall of Fame coach John Wooden�۪s quote: ���Never mistake activity for achievement.�۝In the context of business, the act of logging extra hours or being on call during evenings and weekends does not guarantee results. It can lead to burnout and diminished productivity.No co-founder, myself included, is naive enough to believe that great businesses are built by clock watchers. Disrupting an industry, launching a new product, or overtaking fierce competition takes hard work, and a lot of it ��� but this work should be measured by tangible goals and milestones ��� not hours.Piling onto the scrutiny of a single soundbite from one CEO is not going to solve the broader issue of work martyrdom, but constructive conversations can help. While leaders will differ in their individual styles, I would offer that managers should explore ways that they can prove to their teams that they are committed to their employees�۪ personal growth and overall health.
